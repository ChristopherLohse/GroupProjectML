94.0,Espresso Blend,"Evaluated as espresso. Lush tropical fruit and tart berry dominates with a chocolaty depth that for co-taster Ethan Hill (94) evoked “chocolate-covered raisin and tropical fruit.” Ken (94) for his part cited cleanly sweet alcohol suggestions (“fruity cabernet”), and both remarked on a sweetly tart pineapple top note that carried throughout the profile. For both tasters the mouthfeel was “plush [and] velvety,” the finish a bit drying but still saturated with the fruit and chocolate suggestions. In three parts milk the fruit and chocolate rounded but persisted with satisfying continuity.",$520/225 grams, May 2015
93.0,Seattle Space Blend,"Evaluated as espresso. Big, complex, tartly pungent. Co-taster Ethan Hill (93) remarked on deeply expressed flowers, a very slightly fermenty berry note, and a musky, slightly savory hint. Both Ethan and Ken (92) found the cup “richly and sweetly tart,” though Ken apparently found the tart character a bit less appealing than did Ethan. Mouthfeel was “plush” (Ethan), the aftertaste deep and tartly complex for both tasters, though again, Ken would probably have appreciated the cup finishing on a slightly rounder note. In three parts milk both found the tart intensity untamed and “bordering on bracing” (Ethan).",Price: $13.95/12 ounces, May 2015
93.0,Proud Goat Espresso Blend,"Evaluated as espresso. Both co-taster Ethan Hill (93) and Ken (92) remarked on the subtle, intricate layering of aroma and flavor, which for Ethan involved “lilac, lavender, blackberry … almond.” Both found mouthfeel relatively light but “satiny” (Ethan), the general structure delicate and balanced, the finish softly resonant and berry-toned. Both Ethan and Ken felt the general poise and quiet intricacy of this coffee carried persuasively into three parts milk.",$2000/16 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Dharma Blend Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Both co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) remarked on distinct chocolate, sweetly tart berry and fresh-cut cedar notes. Ken found lavender as well. “Sweet, chocolate-covered cherry” added Ethan. Rather crisply bright for both tasters, with a smooth (“syrupy,” “plush”) mouthfeel and a fine floral and cocoa finish. Filled out three parts milk with tart berry and a balancing sweet chocolate.",Price: $15.50/12 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Pantheon Blend No.1,"Evaluated as espresso. Very discreetly and mildly roast-toned. Ken (93) found the hint of roast fine, maybe even refreshing given all of the bright, lighter-roasted espressos he tastes, but Ethan (91) was not entirely happy with the roasty suggestions. Chocolaty and floral yes, but he also found the blend “bittersweet,” “dry”, even “gritty,” and “lacking complexity overall.” The term “dry” found its way into Ken’s notes as well, but nevertheless he appreciated the chocolate, the caramel, the raisin, the flowers and for him a pleasant hint of anise. True, Ethan did fall in line with Ken when it came to sampling the blend in three parts milk, where both found the chocolate and caramel notes appealing and the floral notes surprisingly clear and persistent.",Price: $30.00/16 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Division by Zero Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Although co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) gave this blend the same rating, Ken was a bit more enthusiastic than Ethan. Both agreed it was a crisply bright, floral-toned espresso (honeysuckle and gardenia for Ethan) with a light, silky mouthfeel. Ethan found a sweet corn undertone in the flavor, Ken a brown sugar note. Both were impressed by the flowers in the “refreshingly resonant” finish (Ethan). In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral brightness clashed a bit with the dairy, though the cup remained “quaintly drinkable”. Ken, on the other hand, felt the milk nicely softened and rounded the brisk, complex flowers.",Price: $16.00/12 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Ganesha Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Co-cupper Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) equally valued this espresso, but read it slightly differently. For Ethan it was a fundamentally sweet cup (“maple syrup”) with layered complexity: blackberry, chocolate, almond. For Ken a crisp, lively, slightly bitterish edge (roasted cacao nib, lavender) complicated the sweetness throughout. Both agreed that the mouthfeel was plump and syrupy. For Ethan the finish was sweet all the way; for Ken it was a touch drying. In three parts milk again Ethan emphasized the sweetness (“retained a nice marshmallow sweetness”) while Ken cited a brisk cocoa-and-lavender character.",Price: $18.00/16 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Wolf Moon Seasonal Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) ended with the same score for this blend though their descriptors varied rather dramatically. Ethan’s emphasized flowers and fruit, Ken’s sandalwood and nut, though both cited a fine, elegant dry cacao note. Both found a refined brightness -- “piquant green grape acidity” according to Ethan – and a light though very smooth mouthfeel. A gentle tart character dominated in three-parts milk but pleasantly so, well-nuanced with cacao, cedar and orangy fruit.",Price: $16.25/12 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Top Shelf Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Exhilaratingly floral. For Ken (92) the flowers were explicit – rose, lily, lavender – whereas for co-taster Ethan Hill (92) the floral character was indirect, expressed in notes of peach, nectarine and coriander. Both valued a sweetly pungent sandalwood character enveloping the foreground floral/fruit notes, and both described the mouthfeel as silky but quite light and the finish bright and mildly drying. Flavor carried with perhaps surprising balance into three parts milk, softening while preserving a brisk floral-and-fruit complexity.",Price: $13.00/8.8 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Revelation Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso.  For both Ken (92) and co-taster Ethan Hill (91) high-toned floral notes and rather bright fruit (nectarine, strawberry) distinguished this complex blend. Very light but buoyant, almost effervescent mouthfeel. Along with fruit and flowers Ken identified a brisk roasted cacao-nib note that for him softened to chocolate in an otherwise rather drying finish. In three parts milk Ethan felt the floral character was muted and the acidity too assertive and out of balance; Ken, on the other hand, found the brisk cacao-and-flowers complex rather pleasing in milk.",Price: $12.75/12 ounces, May 2015
92.0,Dawning Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Both co-taster Ethan Hill (92) and Ken (92) were impressed with deep, pungent aromatic wood notes (sandalwood, cedar) and rich fig and date suggestions. Ken found further complication: musky flowers and chocolate. Ethan felt that the low-toned richness turned rather barley-like in the finish, though for Ken it remained chocolaty. Both were impressed by the blend in three parts milk; for Ken it displayed a “flower-nuanced cocoa and cedar.”",$600/16 ounces, May 2015

91.0,Peruvian Cafe Feminino Cacanor Coop,"Evaluated as espresso. This delicate, gently bright espresso attracted gently expressed support from both Ken (91) and his co-taster (90). Crisp, hazelnut-toned aroma; light but lively, effervescent mouthfeel. Ripe lemon and caramel in flavor and finish, where the co-taster also found a tickle of sweet black pepper. Maintained presence nicely in three parts milk, where the co-taster found it “immensely sweet and clean with lemon character.”",Price: $15.95/13 ounces, May 2013
91.0,Panama Boquete Finca Kotowa Don-K Natural,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (92) showed considerably more enthusiasm for this intense dried-in-the-fruit profile than his only mildly respectful co-taster (89). The co-taster associated the usual fermented fruit notes with wine and spiced cider, Ken with bourbon whisky (which he likes). The co-taster found the fermented fruit notes complicated by “sweet hay and malt,” Ken by a more decisive “fresh-cut cedar.” Ken rated the lightly syrupy, perhaps buttery mouthfeel a bit higher than did his co-taster. Both found the shot pleasantly chocolaty in three parts milk, additionally nuanced by malt for the co-taster, by cedar for Ken.",$450/8 ounces, May 2013
91.0,AIPEP Bolivian Fair Trade Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken rated this softly bright espresso three points higher at 92 than the co-taster did at 89. Ken simply seems to have found more going on and liked what he found better: a fuller mouthfeel, a slightly more complex set of aromatics (for Ken citrus, honey, flowers, chocolate; for his co-taster taster citrus, praline, pear), a longer finish and a more complex, persistent flavor in milk.",Price: $10.75/12 ounces, May 2013
91.0,Guatemala Finca La Perla,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (91) and his co-taster (91) recorded identical scores and very similar readings for this lively, balanced espresso: in aroma and flavor sweetly tart fruit (orange, lemon, kiwi) rounded by flowers for Ken and “sweet pea” for the co-taster; smooth, lightly syrupy mouthfeel; most impressively a very sweet finish with chocolate and cinnamon suggestions. Delicately chocolaty in three parts milk (“pure milk chocolate” according to the co-taster).",Price: $14.00/12 ounces, May 2013
91.0,El Salvador Natural Finca Malacara,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (93) and his co-taster (88) went rather different ways on this deep, sweet, brandyish, lightly herby dried-in-the-fruit profile. Ken enjoyed the overripe, fermenty fruit notes in aroma and cup; his co-taster was not greatly impressed. Both had good things to say about the mouthfeel (co-taster: “huge and enveloping”); on the other hand, neither were impressed by the rather astringent finish. Ken admired the impact in three parts milk (“juicy and rich”) more than did his co-taster, who found it pleasantly berryish but a bit too tart.",$600/8 ounces, May 2013
91.0,Costa Rica Lomas Al Rio Honey Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (91) and his co-taster (90) admired a gently bright, citrus-and-berry character in the small cup; Ken found distinct floral suggestions as well.

92.0,Ninety Plus Nekisse N2 S.O. Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and his co-taster (91) enjoyed this crisp and rather cleanly wine- and brandy-toned dried-in-the-fruit profile, though Ken enjoyed it two rating points more. The co-taster read “berries, pineapple and dried fruits” in the small cup; Ken’s associations ran to parallel descriptors of grape, orange, apricot and fresh-cut cedar. Both admired the shot in three parts milk, citing a deep, balanced sweetness that for Ken was pleasantly viscous and “banana-like.”",$1600/16 ounces, May 2013
92.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Guji Natural,"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and his co-taster (91) admired the wine-like intensity of this dried-in-the-fruit profile, though Ken read more complexity, in particular floral top notes, in flavor and finish. Both tasters cited a creamy mouthfeel and consistent finish. Especially impressive in three parts milk, where the shot bloomed with a complex expression of fruit-toned chocolate.",Price: $15.45/12 ounces, May 2013
92.0,Guatemala Santa Sofia Lot 3,"Evaluated as espresso.

92.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Kochere Grade 1 Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (91) liked this bright, zesty espresso; his co-taster (92) liked it even better. Both admired the citrus and floral vivacity of the aroma and flavor. Ken and his co-taster both accepted the smooth though rather light mouthfeel as an appropriate complement to the lively aromatics; both enjoyed the emergence of a lower-toned fruit (fig, roasted cacao nib) in the finish. Ken found the sweet-citrus impact in three parts milk a bit more pleasing than his co-taster did, though the co-taster offered an apt descriptor for it: “key lime pie.”",Price: $11.00/8 ounces, May 2013
93.0,Organic Colombia SOS Fondo Paez Cooperative,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken (93) and his co-taster (93) both admired this roundly and very discreetly roast-influenced espresso. They found the aroma deeply pungent, the flavor complex with a wide range of sensation: raisin, apricot, flowers, fresh-cut cedar, “crisp, fresh berry” (co-taster). Ken particularly admired the full, syrupy (for the co-taster buttery) mouthfeel. Long, sweet, cedary (Ken’s word) finish. The co-taster in particular made a case for this espresso in three parts milk, where it showed chocolate and a fresh, sugar-cane-like sweetness.",Price: $12.99/12 ounces, May 2013

90.0,Burundi Kinyovu,"Evaluated as espresso. Deep, dark-chocolaty aroma turns crisper in the small cup, which co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) read as dry, “limeish” and floral, Ken (90) as more orangy and anise-like. Rich, dry, very long finish with a clear citrus edge. Two parts milk revives a delicate and cocoaish version of the chocolate, rounding the citrus and flowers.",Price: $10.99/12 ounces, May 2011
90.0,Peru Cruz Del Sur,"Evaluated as espresso. Although Ken (90) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) produced identical ratings, they read this coffee a bit differently, with Sean emphasizing its brightish citrus and floral tendencies while Ken added dark chocolate and hint of brandy. Sean was citrus inclined more toward lemon and lime, Ken toward a deeper-toned orange.

90.0,Mexico Nayarita,"Evaluated as espresso. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (92) and Ken (88) split on this coffee and how to read its deep, ferment-toned fruit. Sean enjoyed the distinctive character of the fruit: “stone-fruited chocolate” with a hint of grapefruit. Ken read the same fruit but also picked up nagging musty/salty tendencies. Two parts milk smoothed things out a bit for Ken, developing a chocolaty sweetness, though Sean remained more committed here also, praising the shot’s “light, sweet, berries and cream” performance in milk.",Price: $14.00/16 ounces, May 2011
91.0,Echo Blend Taiwan Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Ken, at 92, liked this unusual sample better than co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) did, perhaps because Ken read more depth in the aromatics and flavor. Sean stopped at citrus, honey and caramel in aroma and small cup whereas Ken added dark chocolate and pungent fir. Ken also found a bit more going on in the finish, with flowers complicating a deep, bananaish chocolate. In two parts milk Ken and Sean read the cup about the same although applying slightly different language, with Sean citing lemon and ”light caramel” and Ken a “lemony chocolate.”",Price: NT$1500/16 ounces, May 2011
91.0,Single Origin Espresso Colombia El Paraiso Farm,"Evaluated as espresso. Gently tart, lemony, delicate. Co-taster Sean Kohmescher (91) was a bit more lavish in his descriptors than Ken (91): “bright citrus” in the aroma; more sweet citrus, vanilla, hints of flowers and honey in the small cup; vanilla and cranberries in the finish. Ken pretty much left it at lemon and flowers. The lemon dominated in two parts milk, but the milk coaxed out a sweet chocolate to round and support it.",Price: $22.00/12 ounces, May 2011
91.0,Ethiopia Anyetsu Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Complex dried-in-the-fruit profile. “Berries and more berries” in the aroma for co-taster Sean Kohmescher (91). For Ken (91) berries plus a lot of other notes: brandy, malty dark chocolate, fresh-cut cedar. In the small cup Sean felt the aromatics turned crisper and drier: lemon, flowers, green bitters (as in asparagus); Ken read the same rounder, brandyish, cedary berries-and-chocolate notes as he had in the aroma. Both found the body medium and the mouthfeel silky. Rather crisp in two parts milk; cocoa for Ken, lemon and flowers for Sean.",Price: $14.00/12 ounces, May 2011
92.0,Brazil Moreninha Formosa Raisin,"Evaluated as espresso. Although both Ken (94) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (90) lavished a bundle of descriptors on this complex and challenging espresso, the real issue was how much to honor a pungent, musky character as it plays out in a well-pulled espresso. Both Ken and Sean were puzzled by the unusual aroma, but Sean, as he followed it into the cup, found it pleasing but just a bit edgy, perhaps musty, whereas Ken enthusiastically read it rich with the sort of pungent, earthy grapefruit character one finds in the best Sumatras. In two parts milk Sean found this flavor complex “musky” and “antique”; for Ken it was suavely nut-like.",Price: $18.95/16 ounces, May 2011
93.0,Burundi Kiryama Micro Lot,"Evaluated as espresso. Both Ken (93) and co-taster Sean Kohmescher (93) admired sweet-toned floral and bright lemony suggestions broadened by leather-like, musky bottom notes. Medium to full body, syrupy mouthfeel. Cocoaish chocolate and hints of lemon and flowers carry pleasingly into two parts milk.",Price: $13.68/12 ounces, May 2011

Co-cupper Andy Newbom (89) praised the ""absolutely glorious citrus and heavy florals"" in the aroma; Ken (88) a - ""lush fruit, flowers, a hint of cocoa."" For both the acidity was delicate and clean, the mouthfeel ""buttery"" (Andy). Andy energetically reported on flavor: ""high notes of lemon and grapefruit that explode into raw cocoa."" However, both Ken and Andy found a slight hard sensation haunting cup and finish, dampening the explosive aromatics.",, Jul 2009
89.0,"Don Rey’s Private Reserve Bourbon, City Roast","Enthusiastic co-cupper Andy Newbom (89) found this deep, chocolate-leaning coffee luxurious (""sweet and heavy lidded aroma""), balanced (""all-over tongue-hugger""), and complex (""smooth and sultry dark chocolate ... with a hint of lemon/orange and a dash of florals).""  Ken (88) noted a pungent fruit that definitely suggested a nut- and peach-toned dark chocolate, but found a bit less complexity than did Andy.",, Jul 2009
89.0,Kenya AA Neguguini Estate,"Co-cupper Andy Newbom (91) found much to praise (and describe) in this ""complex and serious"" (Andy) coffee: spice, vanilla and chocolate in the aroma, peach and grape influence in the balanced acidity, more spice and molasses together with lemon and orange zest notes in the cup. ""Full and sensual"" mouthfeel. Ken's (88) notes suggest he agreed with Andy on the seriousness of this coffee but harbored some reservations about its complexity. Ken found it ""crisp, quiet, intense,"" with night flowers and dry berry notes in the cup and a simple though rich finish.",, Jul 2009
89.0,Manzano Blend El Salvador,"For co-cupper Andy Newbom (88) ""dried peaches and a hint of prunes struggle to open into dark chocolate"" in the cup. For Ken (89) the sweet dried fruit notes actually make it to dark chocolate, albeit a ""berry-toned"" version. Similarly, Ken tastes the good side of the finish, citing ""long, deep, dry berry notes,"" whereas for Andy an attractive ""dried fruit sweetness"" in the finish was compromised by ""hard mineral fruit notes."" Both noted a ""soft citrus"" [Andy] acidity and a full but slightly rough mouthfeel.",, Jul 2009
89.0,El Salvador Las Mercedes,"For Ken (90) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (88) ""A classic and lovely El Salvador Bourbon with an intriguing twist at the end"" (Andy). Pre-twist, Ken's more general descriptions emphasize dry raisiny fruit, nut, and flowers, whereas Andy's descriptors are more specific, not to mention more extravagant: ""sweet dried nectarines and hibiscus"" in the aroma, ""flavors of stone fruits with apricot leading, hints of yellow pear and apple, a touch of soft lemonosity"" in the cup, ""honey ... chocolate ... peach"" in the finish. As the cup cooled the twist at the end emerged. The hints of nut that Ken cited blossomed into a very explicit, dominating nut character with notes that Andy identified as ""cashew and almond.""",, Jul 2009
90.0,Costa Rica La Legua de Aserri Don Mayo Estate,"""It's sweet,"" reports co-cupper Andy Newbom (90); Ken (90) agrees, though Ken is most impressed by the way sweetness is balanced by a deep pungency. Perhaps that's what Andy is describing when he cites ""Warm peaches and apple blossoms with hints of dark cherry"" in the aroma. Lemon figures prominently in Andy's descriptors of acidity and cup, tart berry in Ken's. Both find suggestions of cocoa nibs, chocolate, and cassis. Andy finds ""an intriguing lavender ... note"" in a finish that Ken describes more generally as ""sweet, rich and deep.""",, Jul 2009
90.0,Colombia Supremo,"Both co-cupper Andy Newbom (90) and Ken (90) emphasized the crisp acidity and balanced structure of this aromatically rather quiet coffee. ""Exquisite crisp green-apple acidity with a touch of kiwi skin"" and a ""nicely smooth mouthfeel with a bit of a fruit leather feeling"" for Andy, who found the green apple carrying into the flavor. For Ken the gently acidy tendency in the flavor suggested dry berry and lemon; both Andy and Ken noted a hint of cocoa nib, a vegetable-toned chocolate. More green apple in the finish for Andy while Ken simply describes a pleasing tart sweetness.",, Jul 2009
92.0,Kenya AA Gatina,"Co-cupper Andy Newbom (92) and Ken (91) both found ways to admire this Kenya. Andy's descriptors circle enthusiastically around flowers and citrus; ""gardenia and lemon-blossom"" in the aroma, ""pears - orange butter and complex mild citrus"" together with ""gardenia and rose"" in the cup. Ken reported parallel, if more generalized, descriptors of black currant, blackberry and hints of lemon, aromatic wood and night flowers. The mouthfeel was ""fat and silky"" for Ken, ""creamy and fruity"" for Andy. Ken was slightly disappointed by what he felt was a slight astringent imbalance in the finish, which for Andy was ""long ... smooth and lingered romantically.""",, Jul 2009
93.0,El Salvador Los Planes Peaberry de la Lagunita,"Both Ken (93) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (92) admired the deep, profoundly fruit-toned character of this coffee. ""Very sweet, richly but discreetly fruity coffee"" for Ken, displaying ""butter, honey, nut, aromatic wood, night flowers, a hint of herb."" Andy read more excitement and less discretion in the fruit character, in which (prepare yourself) ""a menage a trois of raisins, dates and butterscotch got together with tangerine, clover honey and some lemons and raspberries and threw the sexiest block part ever."" Incidentally, sweetly bright acidity, ""round and juicy"" (Andy) mouthfeel, and a finish that resolved the profile with profound sweetness and ""the slightest hint of savory complexity"" (also Andy).",, Jul 2009
93.0,Kenya AA Kiru,"Same admiring scores from Ken (93) and co-cupper Andy Newbom (93) for this smoothly complete, complexly balanced coffee. ""Sweet fruit and spice"" in the aroma for Andy, which provokes ideas of ""stewed jasmine and apricots."" Ken finds flowers and apricot also, along with a little pungent note he calls butterscotch. The acidity is ""smoothly delicate"" for Ken, ""luxurious and suave"" for Andy, who suggests the acidity ""combined the best of both red and golden apples."" Refined flavor with a fine balance of dry and sweet fruit tones. Andy elaborates with an avalanche of allusions to apricot, casaba melon and ""touches of red currant and candied grapefruit."" Rich, deep, ""long and glorious"" (Andy) finish.",, Jul 2009
93.0,Costa Rica San Marcos Micro-Lot,"Co-cupper Andy Newbom (94) admired this pungent yet lushly sweet Bourbon slightly more than Ken (92) did. Certainly Andy found more ways to describe its engaging contrast of lush sweetness and almost savory spice. For Andy ""root beer, lemon peel"" in the aroma, ""fruit leather"" in the acidity; a ""complex blend of tangerine and cinnamon oil, clarified butter and sweet red pepper rounding into guava and gooseberry"" in the cup, plus ""hints of cocoa nib."" The finish impressively resolved the pungent/sweet paradox running through the profile: ""astoundingly clear and bell-toned"" for Andy; ""long, sweetly flavor-saturated"" for Ken.",, Jul 2009
95.0,Ka’u Bourbon,"""An absolutely mind-blowing coffee"" for co-cupper Andy Newbom (93). ""Utterly pure yet soaringly intense,"" for Ken (97). ""Say fruit ten times,"" Andy reports, and then he does, mainly variations of grapefruit, apricot and melon with green apple and Bartlett pear thrown in for the finish. For Ken that entire nuance is wrapped up in the extraordinary, singular explosion of cedary, pungently sweet berry, the quintessential Bourbon character. The acidity is enveloped in sweetness; in Andy's colorful language it ""startles and snuggles all at once."" For mouthfeel Andy suggests ""crème fra&icirc;che Meyer lemon chiffon""; Ken sticks with a pedestrian ""syrupy."" Ken awarded a perfect 10 to the long, balanced, deeply flavor-saturated finish.",, Jul 2009
90.0,Doi Chaang Wild Civet Coffee,"Intriguing mid-tones throughout the profile: mainly a sort of orangy, floral citrus with a backgrounded complex simultaneously suggesting fresh earth, mushroom and decomposing leaves. All of this takes on a vaguely chocolaty tone in the finish. Gently smooth acidity, medium body.",, Jun 2009
92.0,Kenya AA Lenana,"Rich, very intense aroma: dark chocolate, aromatic wood, nut, hints of citrus: orange, tangerine. The cup is influenced by a moderately dark roast, which nicely rounds acidity and turns the celebrated Kenya dry berry notes toward a crisply sweet cocoa or dark chocolate, with a continued shimmer of citrus. The berry-toned chocolate carries into a simple, rich finish. The only limitation of this graceful coffee is a lean, almost thin mouthfeel, though that could be admired as another expression of its complex delicacy.",, Jun 2009
92.0,Mele 100% Kona Coffee,"An exciting, rather unusual complex of sweet but pungent citrus, nut and flowers animates the profile from aroma through finish. The citrus in particular is complex and engaging, one moment suggesting Meyer lemon, another especially sweet grapefruit. One cup of five we sampled displayed a very slight hint of bitterness; otherwise the rating for this exotic coffee would go higher.",, Jun 2009
96.0,Kenya Peaberry Thika Gethumbwini,"Clean, complex, impeccable. Exhilaratingly dominated by crisp, nut-toned dry berry (blackberry, ripe black currant) in aroma and cup.

90.0,Rwanda Ikawa,"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (88): ""This coffee had a complex, well-balanced aroma that reminded me of a vanilla flower, although I?ve never smelled a vanilla flower. I wish more of this had carried over into the cup, because the flavor was not as complex [nor] as interesting."" Ken (92), on the other hand, found the floral and prune-toned fruit character of the aroma carried well into the cup, joined by cocoa and a slight, not unpleasant, salt or savory note. Ken and Jim agreed, however, in praising the richly resonant finish.",, Jun 2009
90.0,Rwanda Coopac Cooperative,"Balanced, pungent character - ""smoky and nutty"" for co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89), ""prune, nut, aromatic wood"" for Ken (90) with rich floral hints. Smooth mouthfeel, round, rich finish.",Price: NA, Jun 2009
90.0,Burundi,"Rich, low-toned, deceptively simple coffee. Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) found it a quietly complete cup, though ""somewhat shy"" in acidity. Both Jim and Ken (90) wrestled with a very slight hint of what cuppers call ""bagginess,"" a faint mildewed note that appears in coffees that have suffered exposure to too much moisture during shipment or storage. The coffee's essential richness and floral cocoa tendencies overcame this shadow note, however, allowing the underlying beauty of the coffee to resonate in cup and long, flavor-saturated finish.",, Jun 2009
90.0,Burundi Bwayi Lot 5,"For co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) a smooth and essentially complete cup but too subdued, with ""unassertive acidity."" Ken (90) found the cup quiet as well, but enjoyed floral, apricot, chocolate, possibly butter notes in aroma and cup, with an acidity that was richly red-wine-like.",, Jun 2009
90.0,Rwanda Bufcoffee Nyarusiza,"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (91) praised a ""spicy pungency"" in the aroma and a smooth, balanced acidity. Ken (89) agreed. Both found the pungent character carrying into the cup, complicated for Ken by hints of flowers and cocoa. Simple but satisfying finish. Jim found the body ""balanced in the light to medium range"" but Ken found the mouthfeel a bit lean, accounting for his somewhat lower score.",, Jun 2009
91.0,Tanzania Hope Peaberry,"Both co-cupper Jim Reynolds (90) and Ken (91) described a very sweet-toned aroma and pleasingly delicate acidity, which Ken glossed as ""wine-toned."" Lightly syrupy mouthfeel, clean and balanced in flavor, ""nutty"" for Jim, tartly fruity and floral for Ken. Very sweet-finishing.",, Jun 2009
92.0,Rwanda Kabuye Cooperative Full Flavor Roast,"Ken (93) favored this coffee considerably more than did co-cupper Jim Reynolds (89) despite the fact that both described it in similar terms. Ken was taken by floral qualities in aroma and cup, an essential sweetness, and what he called a complimentary ""cocoaish dry fruit,"" doubtless the same sensation as Jim describes positively as ""pungent"" and ""spicy and nutty."" Both agreed that the acidity was gentle, though Ken scored it higher and described it as ""crisp and sweet."" Both found the mouthfeel attractively smooth and the finish long and flavor-saturated.",, Jun 2009
92.0,Rwanda COE Lot 16,"Ken (92) particularly admired this coffee's deep, night-blossoming floral character which he felt was balanced by an underlying crisp, cedary cocoa. Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (91) found the profile ""mild"" and caramelly with a soft ? for Jim, a bit too soft ? acidity.",, Jun 2009
93.0,Rwandan,"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds and Ken both admired this coffee, but Ken, at 90, was less admiring than Jim at 95. Essentially, Jim found everything he wanted in an African coffee of this style - a combination of complexity, balance and deep dimension - whereas Ken liked what he found but wanted more of it, more intensity and a more pronounced, distinctive character. Both admired a bright, citrusy but delicate acidity, silky mouthfeel, and a mildly pungent chocolate that Jim described as ""smoky chocolate"" and Ken as ""cocoa and aromatic wood."" Jim found the aftertaste ""lingering,"" Ken found it pleasing but short.",, Jun 2009
93.0,Burundi Bwayi Lot No. 8,"Both co-cupper Jim Reynolds (94) and Ken (91) particularly admired the ""active acidity"" (Jim) of this coffee with its rich berry and floral influences. Jim found the flavor ""complex but balanced."" Ken was more specific: ""dark chocolate, cherryish fruit, a hint of dusk flowers."" Both approved of mouthfeel (""lightly syrupy,"" Ken) and finish (""light, bright and very pleasant,"" Jim).",, Jun 2009
93.0,Tanzania Karmaro Micro-Lot,"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (92) admired the ""spicy, floral qualities"" of this coffee, as did Ken (94), who found blackberry and spicy rose in both aroma and cup. A medium-bodied coffee, but both Jim and Ken remarked on the impressively smooth mouthfeel. Ken showed perhaps a bit more admiration for delicate poise of this coffee, which may account for his higher score.",, Jun 2009
95.0,Burundi Kinyovu,"Co-cupper Jim Reynolds (95): ""This coffee scored well in every category. I especially liked the floral acidity - a nice vanilla and chocolate aspect to the flavor complemented the smooth - very smooth - mouthfeel."" Ken's praise (94) was nearly identical, though he added ""spicy fruit"" and a hint of lemon to his descriptors. Impressive flavor persistence in a long, rich finish.",, Jun 2009
89.0,Joyful-Cimei Blend,"Evaluated as espresso. Sweetly aromatic in the small cup, with soft notes of toast, honey and fruit. Medium to full body with orangey chocolate notes and hints of flowers and caramel. The fruit toned chocolate persists in the bittersweet finish. In two parts milk, toast and cocoa dominate the cup at first, with the orange-like character re-emerging as the cup cools, lingering into the finish.",, May 2009
90.0,Colombia Las Mingas Micro-Lot – Anival Gomez,"The aroma is sweet-toned and alive with flowers, ripe tomato, a hint of cedar; the mouthfeel silky. The issue in the cup is the acidity, sweet but intense, all but sidelining delicate cocoa and floral notes and carrying with dry authority into the finish.",, May 2009
92.0,Sumatra Blue Batak,"Sweet-toned aromatic wood and roundly fruity aroma, with hints that suggest coconut. Medium to full body, soft mouthfeel, balanced acidity, and a complex range of flavors - grapefruit, lime, coconut, sweet table grapes, aromatic wood and a suggestion of flowers. Flavor characteristics linger and sweeten in the long, slightly dry finish.",, May 2009
92.0,Ethiopia Sidamo Oromia,"A graceful floral-toned cocoa dominates. In the aroma very sweet-toned, buttery pungency, flowering grass, orangy citrus. In the cup, gentle, roast-muted acidity, silky mouthfeel, and the impressive floral-toned cocoa that persists into a rich finish.",, May 2009
88.0,Zabava Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Richly and sweetly aromatic in the small cup, with roasty hints of cedar, spice and tobacco. Lightly syrupy mouthfeel with flavors of dark chocolate, more cedar, and sweet notes of lemon and prune. The chocolate becomes more bittersweet in the finish, overlaying a mild astringency. In two parts milk, a roasty, salty-sweet chocolate dominates the cup.",, May 2009
88.0,Rwanda Lake Kivu,"Soft aroma of flowers and flowering grass, lime-like citrus and a hint of milky chocolate. Notes of toast, sweet citrus and dry white wine in the cup, with floral hints reemerging as it cools. Balanced acidity, medium body, with a hint of astringency in the mildly fruit-toned chocolate finish.",, May 2009
90.0,Old Havana Espresso,"Both Ken (90) and co-taster Byron Holcomb (89) enjoyed this blend's natural sweetness. Ken found the sweetness balanced by a ""gentle pungency,"" which could have been another term for what Byron described as dry berry or black currant notes. The aroma was delicate and ""floral"" (Byron), the mouthfeel buttery for Ken and nectar-like for Byron. Nicely balanced and gently chocolaty in four parts hot milk.",, May 2009
90.0,Espresso Classico,"A balanced, gently rich espresso. For co-taster Byron Holcomb (91) ""red wine"" in the aroma and tart jam and boysenberry in the flavor. Ken (89) read the sweetness as caramelly rather than fruit-toned and the dry notes as aromatic wood and leather. Both found the body on the light side but the mouthfeel pleasingly smooth. Rich finishing; Byron picked up lavender as the mouthfeel faded. Four parts milk plumped up the body; Byron read ""granola with fruit, cranberry in particular.""",, May 2009
91.0,Peggy Sue’s Espresso,"Complex espresso with a savory-sweet character and a wide sensory range. Co-taster Byron Holcomb (91) associated the savory-sweet tendencies with Southern comfort food, but for those who don't know sweet collard greens and carrots in butter he helpfully elaborates: The aroma displays ""honey, clove and green veggies,"" the body is heavy, the flavor in the small cup ""light and bright with nice notes of sweet and sour."" Ken (91) more prosaically reads a smoky, slightly salty pungency complicated by lively floral-fruit top notes. Fades slightly in four parts milk but retains a pleasing floral and savory vegetable character complicating the usual milk-influenced chocolate.",, May 2009
91.0,Big Truck Espresso,"""Exciting"" espresso for co-taster Byron Holcomb (91) with a shifty, hard-to-read complexity in aroma and small cup. ""Fruit, chocolate, salty/sweet"" for Byron, ""butter, nut, cedar, earth"" for Ken (90). Medium-bodied, with a long, rich, though slightly astringent finish. But comes into its own in four parts milk, where the ambiguity smoothes, fattens and becomes all good: in Byron's reading, ""milk cocoa with lots of spice notes: ginger, herb, allspice, clove.""",, May 2009
91.0,Espresso Blend #1,"Co-taster Byron Holcomb (92) found more going on aromatically in this poised, balanced espresso than did Ken (89). Byron: ""Aroma notes of brandy, honey and walnut yielded [to] flavors of passion fruit and orange bitters. The aftertaste was ? dry with notes of bakers' cocoa. In milk, some of the great spice notes showed: cinnamon, coriander, allspice.""",, May 2009
91.0,Who’s Yer Daddy Espresso,"For Ken (90) this blend led with the fruity ferment of dried-in-the-fruit coffee, and his assessments reflect his ambivalence toward the type; he read chocolate and an attractive brandyish fruit in the aroma and flavor, but was bothered by a slight, shadow hint of salt.  Byron (92) on the other hand read almost all positives in the fruity richness: ""dark and spicy flavors blended to a round, sweet, nutty finish that left a post-ice-cream mouthfeel. The body was syrupy and sweet. Powerful, dark-chocolate presence in milk, with a slight salt or bitter edge. Byron concludes: ""Strange blend name, great espresso.""",, May 2009
91.0,Italian Espresso Blend,"Ken (92) enjoyed this espresso considerably more than did co-taster Byron Holcomb (89). The reason may have been their differing reactions to the influence of a fruity fermented character that Ken read as pleasingly brandy-like and Byron as dry white wine at best, bitterish seed-and-skin, muscadine grape at worst. Similarly, Ken was more positive toward a fresh-cut cedar character in aroma and flavor. Ken did have reservations about finish, where a hint of the heavy, salty side of the fruit ferment showed up. Byron gave the blend a break in four parts milk, where he described its impact as ""white grape juice, subtle but nice, clean."" For Ken the presence in milk was all good, a ""deep brandied chocolate.""",, May 2009
91.0,The Boss Espresso,"Very complex espresso in which forceful blend components were allowed full, if rather competitive expression. Co-taster Byron Holcomb (90) read the earthy and mildly musty side of the blend: earth and molasses in the aroma, ""musty, cedar - a little confused"" in the small cup. Ken (92) on the other hand, read the confusion as complexity and emphasized the Ethiopian elements, particularly the flowers and fruit, which for him gave the cedar and earth tendencies an anise-like liveliness. Both admired the mouthfeel, which Byron described as ""the same weight as whole milk: buttery and round without heaviness."" Impressive in four parts milk: ""deeply, richly and cleanly chocolaty"" for Ken; toffee-like for Byron, though his reservation persisted: ""still a bit dirty.""",, May 2009
91.0,Don Giovanni’s Espresso Bellissimo,"Co-taster Byron Holcomb (92) particularly admired the aroma of this espresso, remarking on ""distinct notes of saffron, carrots and pistachio."" Both Ken (90) and Byron enjoyed the lightly syrupy, cohesive mouthfeel. Both offered approving descriptors for an unusual flavor complex that Byron described as dry flowers and Ken as anise and herb. In milk Byron found the light, complexly sweet flavor of tres leches cake; Ken may have found that too if he had thought of it, but left to himself he settled on a floral/fruit-toned chocolate.",, May 2009
92.0,Espresso 700 Competition Blend,"The heavily syrupy body of this espresso particularly impressed both Ken (90) and co-taster Byron Holcomb (93) who for his part associated it with the fruity heaviness of mango nectar. The tropical fruit theme also surfaced in Ken's description of flavor and finish, where he found ""bananaish fruit"" along with cedar and anise. Byron also admired the ""subtle, nutty, light nose"" that turned to honey and whiskey in his characterization of flavor. In milk a distinct chocolate was complicated by fruit and floral notes for Ken, berry and agave for Byron.",, May 2009
92.0,Palermo Espresso,"For co-taster Byron Holcomb (92) pleasing ""sweet caramelized"" notes dominated, with some savory hints that together netted a suggestion of ""sweet BBQ sauce."" Ken (91) read the sweet/savory tendencies as flowers and aromatic wood, perhaps fresh anise. Syrupy body, long, cleanly rich finish with impressive flavor persistence. In milk caramel dominated, with hints of nut (Byron), butter and flowers (Ken).",, May 2009
94.0,Bonsai Blend Espresso,"Co-taster Byron Holcomb (94): ""On the nose, I got inviting, complex floral and strawberry notes. The body was vivacious - I could have said round, sweet, with a little savory edge, comforting, but vivacious will do."" Both Ken (94) and Byron found chocolate and malt in the flavor, with an assortment of additional descriptors that testify to the complexity of this blend: ""cedar, butter"" (Ken), ""lemon bar, spice"" (Byron). Both were impressed by the big, sweet, chocolaty bloom in milk, which Byron found was complicated by a continued, brightening hint of lemon zest. It appears that a very controlled, judicious use of cleanly fruity-fermented dry-processed coffees contributed to the round, sweet, complex richness of this versatile blend.",, May 2009
88.0,Harazi Yemen,"Notes of fermented fruit (berry?), chocolate and aromatic wood carry from a rich, sweet-toned aroma into the cup, where they turn muted and rather heavy, though they preserve their concentrated fruit and a halo of chocolaty sweetness. Chocolate notes sustain in a long, relatively astringent finish.",, Apr 2009
90.0,Splendid Espresso Blend,"Sweet, deep, crisp aroma: aromatic wood, toast, hints of flowers and tropical fruit. In the small cup big body, slightly rough but deeply syrupy mouthfeel, notes of flowers, dark chocolate, banana- or coconut-toned fruit. Sweet, rich, flavor-saturated finish. Crisply chocolaty in milk, though it does not completely open and bloom.",, Apr 2009
90.0,Blend Miracle,"Aromatic notes of chocolate and toast, with hints of vanilla and flowers. In the small cup, a lightly syrupy body with complex flavors of berries, stone fruit, caramel, licorice and smoke and a long, mildly roasty, mildly astringent finish. Sweetens and simplifies in milk with pronounced caramel notes and hints of nut and milk chocolate.",, Apr 2009
87.0,Summer Safari Blend,"Aroma and flavor highlight notes of gently charred aromatic wood, dark chocolate and toast. As the cup cools, soft fruit flavors emerge (citrus?) as well as a hint of leather. Roastiness lingers in the finish, developing a cocoa toned sweetness in the long.",, Apr 2009
95.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Beloya Selection 8,"Grandly fruity and sweetly fermented profile: port wine, raisiny dark chocolate, night flowers, blueberry, all carry with giddy intensity from aroma through cup to the long finish. Wine-like acidity, syrupy body, deep sweetness.",, Apr 2009
90.0,S.O. Espresso India CxR,"Deep aroma: sweet nut, hints of orange, toast and vanilla. Smooth, buttery mouthfeel and pungent flavors of cedar, more orange and caramel, toasted grains and a hint of flowers. The sweet nut tone returns in the finish. The subtle flavors found in the small cup turn subdued in milk, limited to a mild, milky chocolate and toasted nut; finishing with a fine sweetness but a hint of astringency.",, Apr 2009
86.0,Organic Papua New Guinea Purosa A,"The difference between co-cupper Jennifer Stone?s score of 84 and Ken's 89 depended on how they responded to a shadow fault in an otherwise impressive, complex coffee. The fault emerged as the coffee cooled; Jennifer simply called it an ""off"" note; Ken described it as vaguely metallic though very faint. Slight fault aside, this is a classic South Pacific profile, gently pungent with aromatic wood and nut notes softened by hints of bananaish fruit and night flowers.",, Apr 2009
88.0,Organic Papua New Guinea,"A sensitive but very dark roast dominates the profile. Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) describes the aroma as ""deep"" and ""complex""; Ken (88) finds dark chocolate and charred aromatic wood as well as floral top notes in the nose. In the cup the body is medium, the mouthfeel ""thin"" (Jennifer) to ""lean"" (Ken) but the general character of the cup is richly and crisply roasty, with continued dark chocolate, charred wood and distinct floral notes, all of which carry with impressive persistence and clarity into the mildly astringent finish.",, Apr 2009
89.0,Papua New Guinea Purosa Fair-Trade Organic,"Both co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) and Ken (90) remark on a distinct natural sweetness running from aroma through a gentle acidity to a long, resonant finish. Ken found more to remark on in regard to aromatic and flavor notes: nut and a hint of milk chocolate in the aroma, a more explicit chocolate in the cup, together with a hint of cherryish fruit. Delicate, rather lean mouthfeel.",, Apr 2009
89.0,Papua New Guinea Light Roast,"Crisp, straightforward coffee; co-cupper Jennifer Stone (89) was impressed by its full mouthfeel and rather deep dimension, Ken (88) by its general balance and poise. The pleasant but muted aromatics were difficult to sort out with any precision; Jennifer tended toward caramel and chocolate; Ken was more into nut. Lest that sounds too much like sundae toppings, these were crisp, bitter-sweet, coffee-contexted nuances.",, Apr 2009
89.0,Papua New Guinea Kimel A,Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (88) remarked on this coffee?s winy acidity and pungent flavor and aromatics; Ken (89) glossed pungent with references to spicy aromatic wood and backgrounded dark chocolate. The finish stays on the rich side of astringent.,, Apr 2009
91.0,Papua New Guinea Peaberry Madan Estate,"Quiet, balanced profile that holds up with particular grace as the cup cools. Co-cupper Jennifer Stone (90) remarks on the clean simplicity of the profile with perhaps a coffee romantic's regret at a lack of aromatic intrigue; nevertheless, both Ken (91) and Jennifer found subtleties in the aromatics and flavor, with Ken reading sweet, subdued citrus and cocoa, Jennifer spicy stone fruit, and both remarking on the distinct floral notes. Softly assertive acidity, medium body, sweet finish.",, Apr 2009
91.0,Papua New Guinea,"Sweet-toned, foresty aroma; co-cupper Jennifer Stone (90) found flowering grass and herb; Ken (91) freshly cut wood and night flowers. In the cup gently bright acidity, full body with lightly syrupy mouthfeel, and continued garden-toned aromatics: flowers (both Ken and Jennifer), nut (Ken), citrus (Jennifer). Sweetness envelopes a slight astringency in the ""resonant"" (Jennifer) finish.",, Apr 2009
93.0,"Papua New Guinea, Kuta Waghi Valley","Ken (93) and co-cupper Jennifer Stone (92) both remarked on the bright, richly floral character of the aroma. In the cup quietly vibrant acidity, smooth mouthfeel, continued gentle richness, with a flavor complex that combines lush night flowers with a sweet pungency pointing at cedar, caramel and deep-toned, carnal fruit: apricot, mango. Long, deep finish.",, Apr 2009
93.0,Kenya Gethumbwini,"Sweet fruity aroma: flowers, citrus, honey and a distant hint of sage. In the cup bright, balanced acidity with medium body and a delicate mouthfeel.

89.0,The Chakra (Wheel) Blend,"Intense aroma: herb, night flowers, sweet berry. In the cup roast-dampened acidity, leanish mouthfeel but rich flavor: herb, aromatic wood, continued night flowers and a berry note that fattens toward chocolate. The herb and chocolate notes in particular carry into a surprisingly round, smooth finish.",, Mar 2009
89.0,Brazil Vista Alegre,"Sweetly pungent in the aroma: cedar, hints of dark chocolate and raisiny fruit. In the cup smooth mouthfeel but a little lean; richly bittersweet; continued hints of a rather dry dark chocolate and raisins. The flavor prevails over a mild astringency in the finish.",, Mar 2009
89.0,Major Dickason’s Blend,"Round aroma: roasty, chocolaty and herbal, with soft hints of fruit. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel and flavors of cocoa, cedar, toast, earth, perhaps grapefruit. Long finish, with lingering notes of sweet aromatic wood.",, Mar 2009
90.0,Yirgacheffe Natural Beloya Organic,"A lush, chocolate- and berry-toned fruit competes with an underlying menthol and Mediterranean herb character that may strike some coffee drinkers as too sharp and others as bracing. The sweet blueberry-like fruit prevails in the aroma, the fruit and savory herb balance in the cup. They split the difference in the finish: the short finish belongs to the fruit and chocolate, the long to the dry, herby mouthfeel.",, Mar 2009
90.0,San Jose Ocana Guatemala,"A gently bright coffee, with a sweet-toned aroma: orange, blackberry and flowers. Fruit carries into the cup - citrus, tart berry and black currant - with the floral note reemerging in the finish, softly fading toward toast.",, Mar 2009
91.0,El Salvador Aconcagua Cup of Excellence Pacamara,"Improves as it moves along. The aroma is delicate, almost too delicate, with only slight hints of chocolate and flowers.

91.0,Guatemala Finca Injerto Pacamara,"Intensely pungent fir, sweet nut and fruit aroma; leanish but smooth mouthfeel; sweet, balanced acidity.

91.0,Organic Brazil Serra Do Bone,"Fine straight-shot espresso. Rich in the aroma with a delicately pungent note Ken (91) called cedar and co-taster Heather Perry (90) spice. In the small cup dense and syrupy in mouthfeel with dark chocolate and continued spice and orangey cedar notes. Long, resonantly flavor-saturated finish. Loses some power and complexity, though it remains pleasantly drinkable and the orangey/spicy chocolate persists.",, Jun 2008
91.0,Sable Espresso Zimbabwe,"Complex, authoritative espresso. Ken (92) found dark chocolate and fresh leather notes in the aroma, co-taster Heather Perry (89) nut. Both remarked on an attractive bittersweet citrus character in the cup, which Heather nicely characterized as ""blood orange."" Ken was particularly taken by the citrusy chocolate finish. But perhaps this coffee's most remarkable performance was in milk, where the crisp fruit bloomed with round, chocolate- and berry-toned assurance.",, Jun 2008
90.0,Panama Boquete Casa Ruiz,"Crisply floral-toned aroma, caramel and pear-toned fruit notes, with a hint of cedary warmth. In the cup medium body with a lightly and pleasantly syrupy mouthfeel.

Clean, sweetly dry finish.",, May 2008

88.0,Brazil Fazenda Cambara,"Sweet-toned aroma with fruit notes that Ken (88) read as banana and co-cupper Ted Stachura (88) as blackberry.

88.0,Brasil Cerrado Fazenda Sao Pedro Lot 307 Natural,"In the aroma cocoaish chocolate with floral top notes. In the cup Ken (89) and co-cupper Ted Stachura (87) both found continued baker's chocolate notes with a lean toward nut.

91.0,Fazenda do Serrado Brasil,"Ken (91) was struck by the pungently sweet berry or black currant notes, which carry straight through from aroma through cup to finish.

In the aroma sweet-toned and balanced with pungent orange and butterscotch notes and hints of flowers and nut. The acidity is gentle and integrated, the cup very sweet but crisp in structure, with continued orange, nut, flower and very distinct cocoa or baker's chocolate notes.

93.0,Orange Bourbon El Salvador,"Pure, finely articulated coffee with notes of coffee fruit (tart cherry), orange and a crisp, minty, distinct but uncandylike chocolate. The chocolate note carries into a finish that remains on the delicately rich side of astringent.",, Dec 2007
92.0,Rwanda Bufcafe,"A deep, roundly low-toned coffee with pleasingly deep, round, low-toned aroma with distinct lemony (perhaps orangy) chocolate notes. In the cup smooth, balanced acidity, silky mouthfeel, and tart cherry and continued lemon-toned chocolate notes. A note that could be called banana appears toward the long, flavor-saturated, very slightly astringent finish.",, Dec 2007
90.0,"El Salvador La Montana, Cup of Excellence #1",Sweet- and low-toned aroma with orangy fruit and cedar and nut notes. In the cup very well-structured with a rich slightly wine-toned acidity and silky mouthfeel but rather simple aromatically: a genial but limited orange- and cherry-toned fruit. A floral hint surfaced in the otherwise simple finish.,, Dec 2007
89.0,"Panama Elida Estate, Best of Panama #3","Impressively intense, sweetly pungent aroma: flowers, chocolate, hints of butter and fresh-cut cedar. Rich, round, smooth-bodied and syrupy in the cup, with pleasing but limited aromatics: dusk flowers and hints of chocolate and dry berry that fade in the rich but simple finish.",, Dec 2007
84.0,Kopi Luwak Robusta Dark Roast,"Evaluated as espresso. As a drip coffee fell quite short of 80. As espresso revealed some virtues. In the aroma sweet-toned with distinct chocolate and butter notes. In the small cup medium bodied, round-toned and sweet, with earth, aromatic wood and herbal notes (I read fennel) and hints of nut and chocolate. The finish was simple in the short and mildly astringent in the long. Surprisingly disappointing in milk: leanish in mouthfeel with banana and chocolate in front but a slight though disturbing note toward the finish that for me suggested salted meat.",, Dec 2007
87.0,Kopi Luwak Arabica Dark Roast,"Intense, deep aroma: distinct dark chocolate, spicy cedar and hints of orange and nut. In the cup low in acidity but rather astringent, with a rich, attractive cocoaish chocolate. Both chocolate and astringency carry into the finish, where the shadow nut tones turn (to my palate) slightly cloying.",, Dec 2007
87.0,Kopi Luwak Arabica Medium Roast,"Intense, low-toned aroma with semi-sweet chocolate, crisp nut (walnut?) and hints of cedar and clay. In the cup fullish body, muted acidity, and a continued intense presence with complex chocolate, walnut and earth notes. A rather heavy astringency when the cup is hot softens as it cools.",, Dec 2007
87.0,Aged Sumatra,"Distinct musty notes in the aroma read as aromatic wood, black pepper, orange, grapefruit. In the cup medium body but syrupy mouthfeel, with continued musty notes that are more explicit here than in the aroma, with aromatic wood, pepper and raw nut dominating. Simple, sweet, mildly astringent finish.",, Dec 2007
89.0,India Monsooned Malabar,"Sweet-toned, deep, complex aroma: spice notes (ginger, cardamom) and sweet clayish earth that suggests a sort of butterscotch. In the cup syrupy mouthfeel, very sweet, almost candyish. Some surprising floral hints surface, and the spicy earth notes turn toward a dark chocolate. The finish is sweet with a slight astringency. A hint of an off note resembling raw potato in some cups discouraged a higher rating for this complex, interesting coffee.",, Dec 2007
89.0,"Kopi Luwak Arabica, Medium Roast","The aroma is sweet and soft with surprising and agreeable floral and fresh orange notes that carry into a heavy, sweet, lushly floral-toned cup. An odd note in both aroma and cup that for me suggested raw, unroasted nuts dampened my enthusiasm for this otherwise distinctive and impressive coffee. This background note struck me as cloying and on the edge of unpleasant, but if you like it then you will no doubt like this coffee, because the dominating floral and orange notes are both unusual and attractive.",, Dec 2007
89.0,"Kopi Luwak Arabica, Bold Roast","Impressive and unique aroma: sweet-toned, delicate yet heavy with notes of night flowers, orange, honey, and moist fallen leaves. In the cup soft acidity, silky mouthfeel, and continued lush notes of honey, fresh fallen leaves and night flowers. The sweetness carries into the finish though the flavor fades quickly. A hint of a note that I associate with raw nuts surfaced now and then. I do not care for this note and neither do most coffee cuppers; otherwise I would assign a rating of well over 90 to this quite unique sensory profile.",, Dec 2007
90.0,Aged Sumatra,"A classic Sumatra balance of sweet fruit and rich earth notes animate aroma and cup. The fruit displays a distinct black-cherry and orange character, particularly in the aroma, though flavor fades rather quickly in the very mildly astringent finish.",, Dec 2007
91.0,India Monsooned Malabar,"Low-toned, simple but resonantly deep coffee, with variants of smoke and chocolate notes running from aroma to cup. As the cup cools the smoky character subordinates itself to delicate chocolate and orangy floral notes. Very clean, sweet finish. The smoke notes, by the way, appear to be a variant on the musty/malty character of the unroasted monsooned beans, not a symptom of a darker roast.",, Dec 2007
92.0,6 Tigers Aged Sumatra,"Sweetly rich in aroma and cup, with ripe orange, clayish earth, caramel, roasted nut and grapefruit notes. The body is medium but the mouthfeel silky. The finish is particularly impressive: rich, sweet and long, saturated to the end with distinct, pleasing grapefruit notes.",, Dec 2007
93.0,Italian Passion Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Muted, nicely modulated fruit ferment notes read as a brandied chocolate in the aroma. In the small cup sweet and deep with fullish body, slightly rough mouthfeel and cedar, flowers and continuing brandied cherry and chocolate. Long, flavor-saturated finish. Sweetens nicely in milk with good chocolate character, though fades and thins a bit toward the finish.",, Dec 2007
90.0,Chopin M?lange Espresso,"Evaluated as espresso. Crisply sweet though rather simple aroma with some complicating hints: fruity chocolate, fresh leather. In the small cup fullish body, smooth mouthfeel, roundly rich but rather neutral in nuance: cedar, semi-sweet chocolate, nut. Recovers in a sweet, clean, distinctly chocolate-toned finish and blooms opulently in milk: round, deep, chocolaty, long-finishing.",, Dec 2007
89.0,Arabica Excellence,"Evaluated as espresso. In the aroma rather bright, high-toned, fruity: cherry, cherry-toned milk chocolate. In the small cup medium-bodied with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel and a continued tart sweetness that reads as a citrus-toned cherry. Clean, rich, simple finish. In milk softens to a delicate milk chocolate with a continued slightly tart edge.",, Dec 2007
95.0,Kenya Kigutha,"Crisp, intense, yet sweetly lyric coffee. In both aroma and cup black currant, blackberry, orange, cherry; in the cup hints of cocoaish chocolate and merlot-like red wine as well. Long, sweet finish just on the rich side of astringent.",, Nov 2007
90.0,"Puro de Puerto Rico, Light Roast","Sweet-toned, delicate aroma: distinct flowers (lilac?) orange, hints of honey and muted cedar. In the cup soft, sweet acidity, flowering grass, cocoa, orange. A slight grassy astringency in the finish suggests that at the time we cupped this coffee it was a bit too young. It may improve in the months following this review.",, Nov 2007
90.0,Kenya AA Lenana,"Deep, complex aroma: smoke, grapefruit, berry, hints of butterscotch and dark chocolate. In the cup delightful in front: crisply sweet, delicately roasty with grapefruit, dry berry and cocoaish chocolate notes. Remains quite sweet and rich in the short finish; grows slightly heavy in the long.",, Nov 2007
89.0,Sumatra Arabica Lake Tawar,"Sweet-toned, deep aroma with cedar, flowering grass, earth notes. Full-bodied in the cup, where the earth notes intensify (think moist, freshly fallen leaves) with nuance that suggests butterscotch and perhaps walnut. Rich, simple finish.",, Nov 2007
87.0,Rwandan Goshonga Reserve,"Deep, sweet-toned, roasty aroma: smoke, butter, flowers, cedar. Simplifies in the cup, where the roast dominates, though with some delicacy: continued smoke, cedar, butter, flowering grass notes. The aromatic notes soften and consolidate toward chocolate in the rich, sweet finish.",, Nov 2007
87.0,Melange Francais,"Crisply roasty in the aroma: gently scorched cedar, cardamom, with a softening hint of semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup lean but silky mouthfeel and a simple but properly robust impression of scorched cedar, spicy nut and a suggestion of dark chocolate. Finishes on the impressively rich side of astringent with good flavor persistence.",, Nov 2007
87.0,Hacienda La Esmeralda Diamond Mountain,"Sweet-toned, deep aroma: cedar, walnut, hints of orange, chocolate and flowers. In the cup sweet, roasty but delicate, with continued walnut, orange, and a cocoaish chocolate. The mouthfeel is silky but a roasty astringency begins to dominate as the cup cools. The finish is rich, sweet and chocolate-toned; it grows slightly heavy as it fades but a sweet chocolate has the last word.",, Nov 2007
94.0,Hacienda La Esmeralda,"Sweet-toned, quietly intense aroma: jasmine, sweet citrus, cocoa. In the cup the mouthfeel is silky, almost syrupy, the acidity intense but delicate with shimmers of white wine. Orange, lemon, cocoaish chocolate, floral notes. Long, deep, flavor-saturated finish.",, Nov 2007
94.0,Kenya AA Mathareini,"Intense, exuberantly complex aroma: orange, grapefruit, honey, cedar, black currant. In the cup the acidity is intense and sweet, the mouthfeel syrupy, the flavor continuingly complex, dry yet lush: black currant, grapefruit, wine, a hint of milk chocolate. The finish is superb: saturated with grapefruit and chocolate, sweet, rich, long.",, Nov 2007
90.0,Espresso Organico,"The surprise here is how well this blend performs in longer milk drinks. As a straight espresso it is agreeable enough, dominated in the aromatics by low-toned, musty notes that read as a raisiny semi-sweet chocolate or perhaps a spicy, cantaloupe-like fruit.  The body is medium to full, the finish simple and rich with a slight astringent edge. The blend exerted a powerful though heavy dark-chocolate presence in short milk, but with more latte-like quantities of milk it bloomed with great sweetness and vivacity.",, Nov 2007
90.0,El Salvador Cerreo Las Ranas,"A very light-roasted, naturally sweet coffee that stays just on the rich side of raw. Low-toned but intense aroma: nut notes (raw cashew?) with hints of flowers and butter. In the cup soft acidity with a shimmer of wine, substantial body, continued sweet raw nut notes with hints of butter, chocolate and flowers. Rich, long, slightly heavy finish.",, Nov 2007
87.0,Yemen Mocha,"Ambiguous flavors associated with fruity mustiness run through the profile. Co-cupper Miguel Meza (87) describes them as: ""Sweet-smoky and medicinal. A pungent and musty full-bodied coffee with exotic hints of eucalyptus, sassafras and bakers' yeast.""  Ken (86) is more conventional and more positive: ""Rich, raisiny dark chocolate with a pungent cedar and herbal edge in aroma and rather syrupy cup.""",Price: NA, Nov 2007
89.0,Organic Ethiopian Special Prep,"Both co-cupper Miguel Meza (88) and Ken (89) agreed that this coffee was low-toned, but for Ken it displayed a quietly resonant depth whereas apparently for Miguel it was simply quiet. Miguel found chocolate and citrus in the aroma, Ken chocolate and a distinct ginger note. Miguel read ""blueberry, over-ripe fruit and toast"" in the crisply fruity cup, Ken dry chocolate, brandy, blueberries, apricot, flowers. Both noted a persistence of berryish fruit in an otherwise rather thinnish finish.",Price: NA, Nov 2007
89.0,Los Lajones Natural Panama,"Co-cupper Miguel Meza's (88) description is succinct: ""Cherry liqueur, smoke and chocolate."" Ken (90) finds a similar palette: dark raisin-toned chocolate, red wine, cherry, flowers. Ken interprets Miguel's smoke notes as a slight hint of complicating mustiness. Altogether a quiet, wood-panels and leather easy chair sort of coffee.",, Nov 2007
90.0,Ethiopia Aricha Seven,"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (89) was rather faint in his praise of this coffee, finding a ""floral and tropical citrus"" character he associates with the more familiar washed or wet-processed Ethiopia profile, with added ""chocolate and berry"" nuance derived from dry-processing. Ken (91) wrestles with the detail a bit more, admiring a wine or brandy nuance to the chocolate and berry character, which he finds ""lush but crisp.""",Price: NA, Nov 2007
91.0,Ethiopian Yirgacheffe Hama,"Co-cupper Miguel Meza and Ken took different descriptive paths in an attempt to characterize the underlying structure of this low-toned, full-bodied coffee. For Miguel (92) the cup was ""soft and comforting"" with a mix of ""dried fruit and mesquite"" and ""berries and chocolate."" Ken (89) felt the cup's sweet yet salty structure dominated the berry- and cocoa-toned aromatics, making the cup attractive but limited.",, Nov 2007
91.0,Ethiopian Worka,"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (91) calls this coffee ""juicy and refreshing,"" Ken (91) ""sweet and deep."" Both were impressed by a crisp, complex aroma (for Miguel ""lemon-lime, cantaloupe and peach"") and as the cup cooled distinct cocoa and sweet ferment notes that Ken read as ""brandied cherry"" and Miguel (with more ambition to precision) as ""distilled agave.""",, Nov 2007
91.0,Biloya Selection One Ethiopia,"A soft cup, rather simple aromatically but ""well-balanced"" (co-cupper Miguel Meza, 91) and ""smooth and deep in structure"" (Ken, 91). Miguel finds ""berries, citrus and chocolate,"" Ken reads some quiet chocolate and perhaps some orange. The finish is quiet but impressive with continued chocolate and fruit (Miguel: strawberry and cherry) notes. (Previously reviewed and rated 92 ponts in June 2007).",, Nov 2007
92.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Aricha Selection #7,"Intense, complex aroma. Quite tropical for co-cupper Miguel Meza (92) who cites guava, pineapple, and orange; Ken's (92) associations are more temperate: blueberry, cherry, orange, honey. In the cup both Ken and Miguel find cherry and chocolate, and most likely Miguel's ""mango and caramel"" and Ken's ""candyish butterscotch"" both are efforts to find descriptors for the same sensation, a pleasingly pungent sweetness. Miguel passes on the finish; Ken finds the usual flaw haunting this style of coffee: a slight salty astringency hiding amid the lovely fading trajectory of fruit.",, Nov 2007
93.0,Ethiopia Beloya Selection One,"Miguel Meza (94) found only purity and ripeness in this opulent coffee; Ken (92) was impressed as well but felt just slightly let down by a limiting simplicity once past the aroma. Miguel Meza: ""Vibrant, pure and ripe ... Creamy mouthfeel with vanilla-like floral notes. Full and balanced with a juicy acidity that hints of peach, orange and berries in the long, clean finish."" Ken (92) admired the ripe, lush aroma every bit as much as Miguel for its ""true dark chocolate, mint, floral and berry"" notes, but observed that once past the aroma the cup simplified despite remaining ""rich and berry-toned."" Miguel and Ken diverged most strongly over the finish, where Ken detected a shadow astringency amid the memories of aromatic complexity where Miguel found only clean flavor.",, Nov 2007
93.0,Ethiopian Aricha Seven,"Miguel Meza (93): ""An intense but slightly flawed cup. The coffee is so luscious and passionate[, however,] that such misgivings are easily forgotten. A dizzying array of ripe and dried berry flavors mingles with banana, lime and chocolate."" Ken (93) agrees, finding a rich mix of ""brandyish cherry, crisp cocoa/chocolate and ripe orange"" notes. He is more specific about the flaw, which for him is a slight salty astringency that ""softens as the cup cools, allowing the ripe fruit notes to fully bloom.""",, Nov 2007
93.0,Arena Selection One Yirgacheffe Ethiopia,"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (94): ""Intensely fragrant: strawberry, kiwi, cherry, amaretto. The cup is powerful, well-structured and dynamic, [progressively revealing] a whole universe of fruit flavor. Only a lingering sharp astringency, perhaps a side effect of he same process that developed the incredible range of flavors ..., limits this coffee from near perfection."" Ken (92) found the lavish aroma and rich acidity particularly impressive, but like Miguel he found a slight nagging astringency in the finish, a shadow to this coffee's monumental yet seductive aromatics.",, Nov 2007
93.0,Ethiopian Aricha Selection 7,"Co-cupper Miguel Meza (92) finds bergamot and flowers in the aroma, Ken (94) finds flowers as well as cherries, red wine, and hints of chocolate and butter. In a cup that is ""sweet"" for Miguel, ""rich and opulent"" for Ken, both read cherries and blueberry and a positive fruit ferment note which Miguel nicely describes as 'Grand Marnier"" and Ken more prosaically as red wine. In either case a slight, pleasing (more so to Ken?) hint of ferment complicates a round, deep, lavishly fruity cup.",, Nov 2007
90.0,Honduras El Filo Cup of Excellence,"Straightforward, lucid, classic. Very sweet-toned aroma with fresh coffee fruit (tart cherry) and honey notes, hints of cedar and lemon. In the cup the honeyish sweetness envelops an intense though not sharp acidity. Continued coffee fruit notes with a lemony lean. Richly tart finish.",, Oct 2007
90.0,Sumatra Mandheling Decaf,"In the aroma deep-toned with moist earth and fruit tones that suggest molassy fruitcake or banana bread or a fruity dark chocolate. The candied fruit, molasses and moist earth complex carries into the cup, riding richly over a slight flatness introduced by decaffeination. Sweet, long, rich finish, very slightly astringent when hot but impressively smooth as the cup cools.",, Oct 2007
93.0,Sumatra Mandheling Aged 2002,"In the aroma the fruity earth tones display an almost candied sweetness paired with a moist-leaf pungency. In the cup medium in body but silky in mouthfeel, with continued candied fruit and moist leaf notes that together hint at a host of associations ranging from chocolate to butterscotch to tartly sweet grapefruit. The flavor-saturated finish is a bit astringent when the cup is hot, but rounds nicely as it cools.",, Oct 2007
96.0,Kenyan Highland Cooperatives,"The aroma is very deep and sweet-toned with lush references to banana, coconut, dusk flowers. In the cup the acidity is extraordinarily rich and round-toned, the mouthfeel supple, the nuance opulent with coconut, red wine, chocolate and floral notes. Rich, long, flavor-saturated finish.",, Oct 2007
95.0,Sumatra Lake Tawar,"Intense, sweetly tart aroma: flowers, cherry, lemon. In the cup the acidity is lyrically sweet, the mouthfeel silky, the flavor vivid with grapefruit, dry berry and floral notes that soften toward a raisiny chocolate as the cup cools. Superb finish: cleanly bright, long, sweet to the far end of sensation.",, Oct 2007
92.0,Kenya Nyeri AA Tambaya Auction Lot,"Deep, pungent aroma: cedar, orange, molasses, honey. In the cup sweetly and crisply acidy, with dry berry, continued citrus and honey notes and an underlying pungent richness that suggests moist pipe tobacco. Flavor-saturated short finish; a slight astringency in the long softens as the cup cools.",, Oct 2007
89.0,Sumatran Lake Tawar,"Deep, roast-influenced aroma: gently scorched cedar, cardamom, orange. In the cup the softly pungent roast and earth tones turn toward a raisiny dark chocolate, with continued distinct orange references. The finish is round, resonant, and stays well on the rich side of a slight astringency.",, Oct 2007
87.0,Jamaica Blue Mountain,"In the aroma crisp walnut, fresh-cup wood, cardamom. In the cup syrupy body, distinct smoky and earthy notes with an underlying sweet candyish character: The whole package could be read as a sort of woodsy butterscotch. Sweet-toned finish.",, Oct 2007
90.0,Panama Carmen Estate 1750 Reserve,"Deep, roundly pungent fruit in the aroma: orange, semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup full-bodied, soft in acidity, and very rich, dominated by a continuing crisp semi-sweet chocolate. Simple but opulent finish.",, Oct 2007
91.0,Colombia La Esperanza,"Deep, lush aroma: cherry, semi-sweet chocolate, flowers. In the cup smooth acidity, supple mouthfeel, sweet- and low-toned fruit and floral character suggesting semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, pipe tobacco. Simplifies a bit in the finish, particularly as the cup cools.",Price: NA, Oct 2007
90.0,Santa Isabel 2007 Nicaragua Cup of Excellence,"As roasted here, a coffee most impressive for its big body and balanced structure. Deep, sweet aroma with honey and cherry notes and hints of cedar and chocolate. Sweet in the cup with quiet acidity, syrupy body, floral-toned honey and a hint of chocolate. Round, rich, simple finish.",, Oct 2007
90.0,Best of Panama #3 Elida Estate,"Very deep-toned, naturally sweet coffee. Chocolate- and cedar-toned fruit in the aroma. In the cup softly and richly acidy, syrupy in mouthfeel, with low-toned fruit that suggests chocolate, cherry, raisin. A hint of flowers as the cup cools. Round, sweet finish.",, Oct 2007
90.0,Kotowa Organico Best of Panama #4,"Rather simple aromatically, but sweet-toned, balanced and rich. In the aroma butter, cedar and a hint of white wine. In the cup gentle, deep acidity, round mouthfeel, continued cedar and white wine notes with a hint of flowers.",, Oct 2007
91.0,El Salvador La Montana COE #1,"A very sweet coffee with a richly pungent, roast-influenced fruit character that defies easy association: for me it suggests lushly pungent pineapple; others might call it black currant or dried berry. Deep, roast-rounded acidity, lush mouthfeel, long, rich finish.",, Oct 2007
91.0,Nicaragua Cup of Excellence Organic,"Very sweet-toned, lavishly floral aroma, with tart coffee fruit and a hint of cedary chocolate. In the cup silky body and the pure flavor of ripe coffee fruit, lush yet crisp, with continued chocolate nuance and perhaps molasses or moist pipe tobacco. The finish reveals a hint of astringency when the cup is hot, but only a cherryish sweetness as it cools.",, Oct 2007
92.0,COE Guatemala Lot #2 San Jose Ocana,"Quiet, shifting complexity in the aroma: orange, cedar, a hint of cinnamon. In the cup lucid, balanced, delicate: gentle acidity, silky mouthfeel, butter and continued orange notes; the cedar/cinnamon hints lean toward chocolate. Hints of flowers in the long, impressively flavor-saturated finish.",, Oct 2007
93.0,San Jose Ocana Guatemala COE #2,"A quiet, very soft coffee with delicate but lush aromatics. In the nose distinct flowers, lemon, butter.

93.0,El Salvador La Montana,"The aroma has great depth and range of sensation: flowers, butter, cherry, hints of chocolate and cedar. In the cup rich acidity, supple mouthfeel.

88.0,Ethiopian Shanta Golba Natural Sidamo,"In the aroma deep, sweet, with exhilarating floral top notes and a fruit ferment that reads persuasively as raisiny chocolate with a hint of cedar. In the full-bodied cup the dark, raisin-toned chocolate and the floral notes sustain, while the pungent tendencies in the aroma intensify, contributing a cedary, herby, rather salty character to the profile. The fine aromatics regain the upper hand in the floral- and chocolate-toned finish.",, Sep 2007
88.0,Organic Fair Trade Italian Espresso Roast,"Evaluated as a regular brewed coffee rather than as espresso. In the aroma roundly and deeply roasty: cedar, cardamom, flowers.

The floral notes dissipate but the fundamental chocolate-banana-toned fruit persists into the slightly tight finish.",, Sep 2007
90.0,Brazil Poco Fundo Fair Trade,"A slight musty fruit ferment serendipitously complicates this richly low-key coffee, reading as cocoa and cedar-toned ripe orange in both aroma and cup. A very slight astringency smoothes out in the long, sweet finish.",, Sep 2007

96.0,Kenya Karogoto,"Floral-toned, intense aroma dominated by the elegantly crisp, dry berry note coffee tasters are fond of calling black currant. In the cup richly acidy.

93.0,Costa Rica La Magnolia Tres Rios,"A soft, balanced, gently lively coffee. In the aroma orange, flowers and a cedary chocolate. In the cup medium body with silky mouthfeel and quiet but distinct floral and orange notes, perhaps with some molasses-toned hints suggesting moist pipe tobacco. Sweet, clean, floral-toned finish.",, Aug 2007
92.0,"Hawaii Ka’u, Will and Grace Farm","Lush, deep aroma with floral, honey and milk chocolate notes. In the cup gentle but intense acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, and a voluptuous floral and honey character deriving ultimately from the flavor of pure, ripe coffee fruit. Simple but long, honeyed finish.",, Aug 2007
92.0,Brazil Fazenda Cachoeria da Grama Cup of Excellence,"Very sweet-toned aroma with hints of honey, lemon, flowers and a slight cedary pungency. In the cup the acidity is quietly soft but wine-like, the mouthfeel silky, the flavor dominated by a continued honeyed sweetness and a balancing cocoa and walnut crispness.",, Aug 2007
89.0,Latin BreeZe,"In the aroma crisp, deep, cherryish fruit and fresh-cut cedar. In the cup leanish mouthfeel with a continued crisply roasty character, slight smoky edge and an undercurrent of ripe fruit. The finish is simple but round and rich.",, Aug 2007

88.0,Sumatra (Beveo),"(As produced in a Beveo concentrate coffee machine at the setting netting the second to ""strongest"" ratio of coffee concentrate to water): Very sweet-toned, caramelly aroma with hints of butter, earth and green apple. In the cup smooth mouthfeel and simple but agreeable flavor dominated by very sweet but pungent fruit notes - think dried pear or apple rather than fresh. Sweet, rich, gently tart finish.",, Aug 2007
83.0,Amalfi Dark Roast,"Sweet, low-toned aroma: toast, banana-like fruit. In the small cup medium-bodied with a leanish, slightly rough mouthfeel and toast and gently scorched cedar notes. Simple, rich short finish with a heavy saltiness in the long. In milk simple, with little sweetness; the usual chocolate turns up dry and salty.",, Aug 2007
85.0,Espresso,"Toast and banana-like fruit notes dominate in the aroma, hinting at a roasty chocolate. In the small cup medium-bodied but leanish and a bit astringent in mouthfeel, sharp in structure with dominating cedar notes and continued hints of a banana-like fruit and chocolate. Rich and rather sweet in the short finish, heavily astringent in the long. Simple but solid presence in milk with the muted fruit modestly blooming as semi-sweet chocolate.",, Aug 2007
86.0,Selection A Light Roast,"Balanced, simple aroma with muted floral and temperate fruit notes. Rather lean bodied in the small cup, gently crisp, with cedar notes and a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Surprisingly rich, clean finish. Thin in milk, though the chocolate notes fatten and sweeten.",, Aug 2007
87.0,SuperCrema,"Crisply sweet, deeply fruity aroma: cherry, sweet orange, milk chocolate. Slightly lean and sharp in the small cup, tartly sweet, with mild cedar and continuing citrusy and cherryish fruit notes. Moderately rich but simple, rather astringent finish. In milk blooms nicely with a cherryish dark chocolate. Slightly heavy finish.",, Aug 2007
88.0,Gold Espresso,"Sweet-toned aroma with an orange-toned nut character. In the small cup smooth, syrupy mouthfeel, sweetly pungent through the finish with continued orange and woody nut nuance. In milk the nut and orange notes sweeten toward chocolate but never quite bloom.",, Aug 2007
88.0,Black Cat Espresso,"Rich, roundly pungent aroma: caramel, orange, hints of flowers and chocolate. Medium bodied, a touch rough in mouthfeel. The richly pungent, cedary character carries into the cup with continued orange, raisin and semi-sweet chocolate notes. The finish is rather astringent but rich, with good flavor persistence. The pungent character softens in milk with the orangy chocolate sweetening nicely.",, Aug 2007
88.0,Extra Mild,"Round, gently fruity in the aroma: raisin, nut, a hint of vanilla. In the small cup smooth mouthfeel on the cusp of syrupy and silky; low-toned and neutral in flavor, with cedar notes and the barest suggestion of raisin and nut. Carries with impressive resonance into a long finish. Good presence in milk, though the rich, nut-toned dark chocolate betrays a slight woody, salty side.",, Aug 2007
89.0,Garuda Blend,"Lovely aroma: sweet-toned, gently pungent, with distinct floral and complex fruit (banana, plum, orange) notes. In the small cup medium-bodied with a lightly syrupy mouthfeel and crisp, cedary structure; the fruit turns darkly chocolate. Chocolate and orange carry into a slightly heavy finish. In milk balanced, crisp, though the fruit and chocolate doesn't completely soften and bloom.",, Aug 2007
89.0,Espresso Coffee,"As usual this famously refined espresso comes across either as elegantly refined or excessively delicate depending on taste, expectation and (despite Illy's rigorous quality assurance) slight variations in the blend itself. This time around I was impressed by the purity of the aroma and its floral, apple, lemon and milk chocolate notes. The mouthfeel certainly is not fat, but could be praised as silky. The cup could be criticized as a bit too sharp and simple, or valued (as I did) for its gentle tartness and hints of cedar, flowers and lemon. The finish could be praised for its floral and fruit persistence or criticized for a slight lean toward astringency. In short milk one could find it quietly sweet with a fine crisp chocolate (as I did) or lazy and wanting in power and fatness.",, Aug 2007
90.0,Crema d’Oro,"Rich, balanced but subdued aroma: pruny fruit, nut, a hint of chocolate. In the small cup fullish in body with a slightly rough mouthfeel, aromatically simple but sweetly resonant in structure with hints of cedar and chocolate. Clean, sweet finish. Comes into its own in milk, where it blooms richly with a deep, malty chocolate.",, Aug 2007
92.0,Premium Bar Blend,"Sweet-toned aroma with a musty fruit that suggests bananas, dark chocolate and raisins. In the small cup syrupy but slightly rough mouthfeel, sweetly and richly pungent with a cedary semi-sweet chocolate that persists nicely into the finish. Impressive in milk: rich, with a sweet, mint-finishing dark chocolate.",, Aug 2007
93.0,Massimo,"As a straight shot extraordinarily syrupy and liqueur-like. The aroma is sweet and round with a musty ferment that reads as a sort of drunken/brandyish chocolate. In the small cup startlingly full-bodied and smoothly viscous with long-finishing, tight-knit complexity that ranges in suggestion from carnal melon to semi-sweet chocolate to sweet, pungent, molasses-toned tobacco to an earthy morel mushroom. Curiously, given its monumental body, fades and thins in milk, the chocolaty notes persisting but not blooming.",, Aug 2007
89.0,Golden Sumatra,"Sweet, deep aroma with chocolaty fruit and a hint of flowers. Silky mouthfeel, smooth in the cup with semi-sweet chocolate and orange peel notes. Rich and sweet in the short finish; a recurring hint of flowers and a slight astringency in the long.  As the cup cools the orange-toned chocolate persists sweetly but the body thins.",, Jul 2007
95.0,Ethiopia Natural Yirgacheffe Aricha Special Microlot,"Intense aroma: nut, mint, brandied cherry chocolate. In the cup rich acidity, silky body and a continuing aromatic profile so deeply and explosively complex that a world of coffee sensation can be found in it: cocoaish chocolate, raisin, flowers, lemon, brandy, orange peel. Very sweet and flavor-saturated short finish, though in the long a very slight salty astringency shadows the fine aromatic echoes.",, Jul 2007
92.0,Aged Sumatra Lintong Vintage 2004,"A superb example of its type, though not a coffee for the conventional. Wood and musty earth notes in the aroma are enriched by butter and orange that together read persuasively as a sort of butterscotch. Rather lean-bodied but very sweet in the cup with orange, pipe tobacco and continued butterscotch notes. In the finish suddenly blossoms and soars, with altogether new and surprising chocolate and even some giddy floral notes.",, Jul 2007
90.0,Papua New Guinea Kunjun Estate,"Lushly complex aroma: flowers, honey, molasses and sweetly tart fruit notes that suggest grapefruit. In the cup moderate in acidity, medium in body, with an opulent candyish, molasses-toned floral character and continued tart fruit notes enriched by a slight, brandy-like ferment. Clean, rich finish. The cup flattens very slightly as it cools.",, Jul 2007
95.0,Aricha Selection Seven Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"No hints here: The aromatics are direct, inescapable, lavish. Lushly intense blueberry, chocolate, and floral-toned honey in the aroma. In the cup the incendiary aromatics are influenced by a wine-like acidity that turns the berry and chocolate notes crisp and richly dry. The fundamental berry and floral notes linger with surprising clarity in the finish, although they are outlasted by a slight but forgivable astringency.",, Jul 2007
89.0,Arbor Day Blend,"Deep, sweet-toned aroma with distinct floral top notes and hints of butter and cedar. Simplifies slightly in the cup, but remains deep, balanced and big-bodied, with semi-sweet chocolate notes that carry into a richly clean finish.",, Jul 2007
85.0,Yauco Selecto Puerto Rico,"Opens well: Very sweet-toned, deep aroma with a hint of mustiness that merely complicates a tight-knit, delicate complexity: cedar, semi-sweet chocolate, dry berry, orange. In the cup remains sweet, but the musty character dominates, narrowing the aromatics toward a sort of rough, cedary chocolate. Rather tight, salty finish.",, Jul 2007
87.0,Jamaica High Mountain Supreme Baronhall Estate,"Sweet-toned, delicately rich aroma: hints of flowers, milk chocolate, orange, molasses. In the cup the mouthfeel is lean to the point of watery, with aromatics so delicate they almost don't register: orange, molasses, pipe tobacco, and nut-like notes that hint at chocolate. Impressively clean, sweet finish.",, Jul 2007
87.0,Haitian Bleu,"Soft aroma, with floral top notes, and prune- or apricot-toned fruit and a hint of chocolate. Simplifies in the cup, turning gently bittersweet. The deep-toned, prune-like fruit grows more pungent, the chocolate hints drier. Smoothes out again in the impressively sweet, finish.",, Jul 2007
87.0,"Jamaica Blue Mountain Clifton Mount Estate, Medium Roast","Crisp, rather limited aroma: caramel and milk chocolate. In the cup sweet, delicate, rather shallow and lean, with a pleasant dry nutty chocolate character. Unexpectedly, the finish stretches out splendidly, rich and chocolate-toned.",, Jul 2007
88.0,Bahama Breeze Blend,"Sweet-toned, deep aroma with distinct orange notes and hints of nut and semi-sweet chocolate. The cup is dominated by a plush orange- and wine-toned acidity, sweet and richly balanced, with continued hints of dry chocolate that carry into a richly astringent finish.",, Jul 2007
89.0,"Jamaica Blue Mountain – Medium Roast, 2006-07 Crop","Very sweet-toned, very deeply dimensioned aroma, with lush cedary chocolate notes and hints of banana and molasses. In the cup plush in mouthfeel, roundly resonant, chocolate-toned. Rich but simple finish.",, Jul 2007
91.0,Jamaica Blue Mountain,"Sweet-toned, soft, very delicate aroma with orange, floral and pungently buttery (butterscotch?) notes. In the cup light to medium bodied but silky in mouthfeel, with a gently bittersweet character and crisp chocolate and orange peel notes. As the cup cools an attractive mint-like note also emerges. The chocolate and orange notes linger impressively in the long, clean finish.",, Jul 2007
92.0,Costa Rica La Minita Estate,"Pure, balanced, quietly complete. Sweet-toned, deep aroma with rounded fruit notes, butter, milk chocolate, a hint of flowers and lemon. In the cup rich acidity, silky mouthfeel and continued understated milk chocolate, butter and tart-cherry coffee-fruit notes. Sweet, consistent finish.",, Jun 2007
95.0,Kenya Peaberry Deep River Estate,"In the aroma delicately complex: berries, flowers, sweet lemon, honey. In the cup opulent: syrupy mouthfeel, sweet acidity, crisply powerful berry notes, continued hints of honey and flowers. Only a rich but simple finish prevents this coffee from rating in the high 90s.",, Jun 2007
93.0,Guatemala Antigua Actasa,"A grandly classic coffee, very sweet and deep in the aroma, with berry- and cherry-toned fruit and a balancing hint of crisp lemon and cedar. The cup is dominated by a full, lush acidity: gently tart yet almost sugary sweet. The dry berry and cherry notes persist in the rich finish.",, Jun 2007
92.0,Biloya Selection One Ethiopia,"Lushly sweet cherry-brandy and chocolate-toned aroma with hints of cedar and banana. Continued hints of buttery-textured tropical fruit in the cup supporting continued rich, grapey brandy and cherryish chocolate notes that turn toward blueberry as the cup cools. The complex fruit persists in the finish, though shadowed by a slight salty astringency.",, Jun 2007
89.0,Costa Rica Biasetti,"In the aroma sweet-toned, deeply but gently roasty, with unusual lemon-floral character and background hints of chocolate and smooth, banana-like fruit. The cup displays a delicately pungent, roast-rounded acidity, rather lean mouthfeel, richly crisp lemon and background chocolate notes. The finish hovers on the rich side of astringent.",, Jun 2007
88.0,Espresso Organico,"Very sweet-toned aroma, intense though simple: hints of potato, orange and nut. As straight espresso medium body but syrupy mouthfeel with a smoothly pungent character and a quiet complexity: molasses, orange, nut and a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Full, deep, slightly salty finish. In milk displays a rich semi-sweet chocolate, but a bit light on sweetness and presence.",, Jun 2007
91.0,Coastal Blue Blend,"An extreme dark roast that preserves impressive depth and complexity. Intense, deeply pungent aroma: toast, smoky cedar, rosemary, lemon notes. In the cup, medium body, smooth mouthfeel, sweetly roasty, with continued hints of lemon and herb and a smoky semi-sweet chocolate. In the finish rich sweetness upstages a hint of heavy astringency.",, Jun 2007
88.0,Bumpkin Espresso,"Deep, sweet-toned aroma: smoke, toast, banana-like fruit leaning toward chocolate. In the small cup medium body, smooth and balanced in structure. The chocolate turns crisp and cedary. Continuing hints of candied fruit or banana. Very pronounced presence in milk: The chocolate is elegant and complex, with continued banana and perhaps mint tones.",, Jun 2007
87.0,Port of Call,"Very sweet-toned aroma with a muted, pungent complexity: hints of semi-sweet chocolate, cedar, cardamom, honey, orange. In the cup simple, gently rich, with distinct semi-sweet chocolate notes and a hint of honey and caramel. Cleanly rich finish.",, Jun 2007

88.0,Tanzania Peaberry,"Low-toned and nut-like aroma with a hint of chocolate. In the cup round, simple but resonant, with fruit that carries hints of chocolate, red wine, orange perhaps. Rich and sweet in the short finish, a bit heavy in the long.",Price: NA, Jun 2007
88.0,Rwanda AA Rusenyi Bourbon,"Gentle, balanced, agreeably simple aroma, with distinct floral notes and a hint of milk chocolate. The floral tones carry into a soft, sweet cup with orange and a spice note that could qualify as cinnamon. Flattens a bit in the finish but remains sweet.",, Jun 2007
89.0,La Lucie Zimbabwe,"Very sweet throughout the profile. Nut and semi-sweet chocolate notes in the aroma. In the cup tart coffee fruit notes make a distinct and delicate lean toward chocolate. The tart cherry tones persist in the sweet short finish, fading toward astringency in the long.",, Jun 2007

89.0,Tanzania Peaberry,"Deep, smoky, sweet-toned aroma with cedar and orange tones and an herby note. In the cup medium-bodied with a tickle of acidity, crisply sweet, gently smoky, with continued deep-toned orange or perhaps tangerine tones. The finish continues sweetly roasty and free of astringency.",, Jun 2007
90.0,Zimbabwe Pinnacle,"A big, sweetly acidy coffee, with distinct floral and molasses notes in both aroma and cup. The body is medium but the mouthfeel silky and supple. Tart coffee fruit notes in the cup lighten and complicate a slightly tight finish.",, Jun 2007
90.0,Tanzanian Gombe Reserve,"Dominated throughout the profile by crisp, complex dry berry notes (think blackberries and cedar) with deep, sweet undercurrents of honey and chocolate that emerge with particular clarity as the cup cools. The tart berry notes also carry suggestions of dry, light-bodied red table wines.",, Jun 2007
90.0,Tanzanian AA Mt. Meru,"The dry, crisply pungent berry character we call black currant gently dominates throughout the profile. In the aroma it takes on a light-red-wine-like character, while in the cup it is enveloped in a quiet background sweetness. Soft acidity, delicate body, simple finish.",, Jun 2007
92.0,Rwanda Karaba Super Lot 2007 Fair Trade,"Deeply and sweetly acidy throughout the profile. In the aroma intensely floral with orange, honey and pipe tobacco. In the cup the mouthfeel is syrupy, the acidity cherry-toned and lush. Sweet, rich finish with fine flavor persistence in the short, slight astringency in the long.",, Jun 2007
92.0,Rwanda Karaba Koakaka Fair Trade,"Sweet-toned, soft aroma with flickers of flowers, chocolate and pear-like temperate fruit. In the cup quietly acidy, with a richly syrupy mouthfeel and a round, balanced structure. Continued flowers, chocolate and fruit, though in the cup the fruit is more honeyish date than pear. Simple, rich finish.",, Jun 2007
92.0,Rwanda Bourbon Ingoboka Cooperative,"Intense, complex but elegant aromatics - flowers, chocolate, butter (or perhaps butterscotch), cherryish fruit - carry from nose through cup into the short finish. The acidity is gentle and balanced, the mouthfeel lean but delicate.",, Jun 2007
91.0,Espresso Reserve,"Pungent, sweet-toned aroma with banana, honey, chocolate, and a hint of cedar. The pungent cedar notes intensify in the small cup, supported by a deep, enveloping sweetness and viscosity. Here the syrupy honey and banana notes are more felt than tasted, and segue into an impressively long, cleanly resonant finish. In milk the cedar and fruit tighten and simplify somewhat, reading as a crisp semi-sweet chocolate.",, May 2007
97.0,Ethiopia Biloya Special,"Intense, sweet-toned, chocolate and blueberry aroma with a slight pungent edge. In the cup sweetly acidy, with a full, syrupy mouthfeel and lavish red wine and blueberry notes. The finish is rich, berry-toned and extraordinarily clean for this style of coffee.",, May 2007
78.0,Simply Smooth,"Sweet, simple aroma dominated by walnut and neutral wood notes. In the cup lean in mouthfeel with some raisiny fruit in front, but the main sensation is salty wood - think licking driftwood. The salty/sweet theme continues in the finish, though the fruit hangs on, an agreeably soft banana-like sensation. It's difficult to assign a rating to such an oddly woody, lifeless beverage; but it does show sweetness and a little agreeable fruit, hence the 78 as opposed to, say, 60, or 50, or 0.",, May 2007
83.0,Regular Gourmet Low Acid Coffee,"Sweet, woody, simple aroma: perhaps some pipe tobacco and lemon notes. In the cup definitely mild in acidity with a caramelly sweetness, but all suggestions of normal coffee aromatics vanish, with the main sensation a neutral woodiness that carries from cup into a sweet but rather empty finish.",, May 2007
84.0,House Blend,"Simple, gently roasty aroma: toasted bread, lightly charred cedar, hints of cardamom and dried fruit, dried cherries perhaps. In the cup leanish mouthfeel with good sweetness but rather flat and simple, with continued charred cedar and perhaps some walnut notes. The nut notes dominate in the short finish; the long finish is sweet but slightly astringent.",, May 2007
85.0,Idee Special Stomach Friendly Coffee,"Sweet, delicate, nutlike or carob-like notes and a hint of flowers in the aroma. In the cup medium bodied, with continued sweet nut, prune and carob notes together with agreeably persistent floral nuance. As the cup cools and the aromatics begin to fade a woody, albeit a richly woody, character emerges. Sweet, short finish with a slight, gentle astringency.",, May 2007
88.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Intense aroma in a narrow range: pungent rosemary-like herb notes, an orangy citrus, and some slightly charred wood notes. In the cup lean-bodied but forceful, dominated by a grapefruity pungency with a slight charred edge that with imagination reads as a semi-sweet chocolate. The chocolate is explicit, however, in the impressively sweet, long finish.",, May 2007
88.0,Brazil Fazenda Boa Sorte Natural Catuai,"Sweet-toned and rich aroma with some floral notes. In the cup medium body, silky mouthfeel, low acidity, sweet, low-toned, rich, with chocolate notes and a hint of walnut. Rich short finish; the mildly bitterish walnut tones dominate in the long.",Price: NA, May 2007

90.0,Brazil Poco Fundo,"A slight, serendipitous hint of sweet ferment complicates the rich fruit, turning it toward a chocolaty, brandyish cherry or orange with a hint of blueberry. The chocolate takes on an almost minty character in the sweet, very low-acid cup. As the cup cools a bare suggestion of bitterness surfaces, the shadow side perhaps of the rich, fermenty sweetness.",, May 2007
95.0,India AA Elkhill Estate,"An extraordinarily pure coffee in a dramatically light roast style. Sweet nut, fresh-cut cedar and orangy citrus in the aroma. Medium-bodied and giddily sweet in the cup, delicate but rich, with low, wine-toned acidity, an orange-toned fruit and hints of nut, flowers and chocolate. The complex fruit notes carry into a quietly rich, clean finish.",, May 2007
93.0,Ethiopian Shilcho,"Very sweet-toned but crisp aroma: distinct lemon, floral and chocolate notes. In the cup big-bodied, with a dry, lemony chocolate simultaneously delicate yet intense. The chocolate takes on a breathtakingly sweet floral and blueberry character as the cup cools. Continued chocolate and flowers cover for a slight salty astringency in the long finish.",, Apr 2007
92.0,Sumatra Blue Batak,"Deeply pungent, tightly complex aroma: grapefruit, earth, caramel, perhaps a hint of butter. In the cup fat bodied, sweetly pungent, with earth tones that lean toward a rich malt. The sweet-toned finish stays on the robust, rich side of astringent.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Kenyan AA Extra Bold K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): Distinguished by a sweet, gently tart fruit note in aroma and cup that reads as a sort of crisp orange- and chocolate-toned blackberry - or call it ""black currant,"" a term for this flavor note in vogue among coffee describers. Whatever we call it, it is a precious and agreeable sensation. The body is medium and the mouthfeel silky at a 6-ounce serving, slightly thinnish and lean at 8. Rich finish with good flavor persistence and excellent stability as the cup cools.",, Apr 2007
86.0,Colombian Dark Decaf (Beveo),"(As produced in a Beveo concentrate coffee machine at the setting netting the ""strongest"" ratio of coffee concentrate to water): Very sweet-toned aroma, simple though pleasingly buttery and caramelly. In the cup medium in body but pleasantly silky/syrupy in mouthfeel, with simple caramel character and some floral and perhaps chocolate hints. Sweet finish with continued buttery notes. Hints of a woody character are hardly discernible when the cup is hot, though more explicit as it cools.",, Apr 2007
87.0,Kona 10% Blend Extra Bold K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): The aroma displays a simple, pure coffee character: tartly sweet, chocolate-toned fruit and a hint of flowers. In the cup medium but silky bodied at 6 ounces, slightly thinnish at 8. At both serving sizes quite sweet, gently tart, with continued delicate chocolate-toned fruit notes. Nice persistence of chocolate and flowers in the finish, although this delicate, lyric coffee stiffens and simplifies a bit as the cup cools.",, Apr 2007
86.0,Premium Blend (Beveo),"(As produced in a Beveo concentrate coffee machine at the setting netting the ""strongest"" ratio of coffee concentrate to water): Intense, caramelly but crisp aroma with prune-like fruit and chocolate notes. In the cup medium in body but pleasantly silky/syrupy in mouthfeel; sweet in structure with distinct caramel notes and fruit that here seems more orange than prune. Walnut notes as the cup cools. Sweet, rich, simple finish. Throughout the profile very remote hints of a woody character lurk, though they are only apparent with close - perhaps paranoid - attention.",, Apr 2007
86.0,Espresso Blend Extra Bold K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule to produce 6-ounce and 8-ounce serving sizes): Considerably more impressive in a 6-ounce serving size than in an 8. At 6 ounces the aromatics in nose and cup are pleasingly buttery and round with a crisp roasty edge and hints of caramel and chocolate. At 8 ounces the mouthfeel is a tad lean and the aromatics thinnish.",, Apr 2007
87.0,Colombian Dark Roast (Beveo),"(As produced in a Beveo concentrate coffee machine at the setting netting the ""strongest"" ratio of coffee concentrate to water): Intense, round, very caramelly aroma with orange-toned citrus notes.

89.0,Cowboy Roast,"Very impressive aroma: sweet, deep, with a gently rounded pungency and distinct grapefruit notes with background cedar and semi-sweet chocolate. Medium-bodied with a smooth, astringency-free mouthfeel. The aromatics simplify in the cup and finish, although they remain pleasing: continued round pungency and a roasty semi-sweet chocolate. Rich finish with only slight astringency.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Costa Rican Tarrazu,"In the aroma roundly and sweetly acidy with floral-toned coffee fruit and a hint of chocolate. In the cup gently acidy, medium-bodied with a smooth, almost syrupy mouthfeel. The aromatics remain simple, dominated by a floral-toned coffee fruit (think tart pie cherries).",, Apr 2007
86.0,Indonesia Celebes Kalossi,"An extreme version of the traditional musty/earthy coffees of Indonesia, with the musty notes so intense that they seem to push the profile into a realm completely outside ordinary expectations associated with coffee. The earthy mildew character is sharply pungent but sweet throughout, with associations with other pungently sweet sensations, like grapefruit and the fresh smell of tomato vine.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Java Blawan Estate,"Sweet-toned, mildly pungent aroma: cedar, molasses, a hint of milk chocolate. Very sweet in the cup and very delicate, with wispy walnut and continued milk chocolate notes. Surprisingly robust persistence of sweetness and flavor in the short finish; some astringency in the long.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Sulawesi Toraja,"Deep, rich, opulently sweet-toned aroma: cedar, hints of honey and orange. Heavy body and robustly rough mouthfeel in the cup, with a pungently earthy character that reads persuasively as a sort of dry but raisin-toned chocolate. The rich depth extends to the short finish, though astringency nags in the long.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Java Blawan Estate,"A quiet coffee. A subtle aromatic complex runs pleasantly through the profile from aroma through cup, so subtle it's hard to pin down with specific associations: milk chocolate and banana I wrote for the aroma; switched to butterscotch for the cup, with a stiffening hint of walnut. The acidity is gently lively; the finish surprisingly rich given the quietness of the cup.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Java Blawan Estate,"A delicate - perhaps overly so - coffee that nevertheless rewards attentiveness to its subtle, complex aromatics: floral tones and a pungent note suggesting the fresh odor of tomato vines, with background suggestions of cocoa and white wine. A heavy astringency lurks in the mouthfeel that unfortunately dominates in the long finish as the heady aromatics fade.",, Apr 2007
88.0,Aged Celebes,"A wonderfully sweet coffee whose lush character is balanced (or opposed) by a sharply musty earthiness. Taken together these tendencies read as a pungent citrus, grapefruit perhaps. Full body, very syrupy mouthfeel. Rich and very sweet in the short finish; in the long the musty tones introduce a mild astringency.",, Apr 2007
89.0,Java Estate Pancour,"More Sumatra than Java: pungent, sweet earth notes dominate with distinct chocolate and tomato leanings. The earthy chocolate notes carry into a sweet short finish, slightly astringent long.",, Apr 2007
90.0,Estate Java,"A strikingly distinctive coffee that suffers a bit in the finish. Splendid aroma: sweetly and deeply pungent, with floral, chocolate and pipe tobacco notes. In the cup low-toned but vibrant acidity, crisply nut-like with distinct orange notes. The nut notes turn very slightly stiff and dusty in the finish.",Price: NA, Apr 2007
90.0,Timor Maubesse Fair-Trade,"Almost sugary sweet throughout the profile. Flowers and cedar in the aroma; the floral notes give way to a more pungent, tomatoey fruit and hints of cocoa in the cup. The sweetness carries straight into a rich short finish, fading to a mild astringency in the long.",, Apr 2007
92.0,Bali Paradise Valley,"Extraordinarily sweet-toned, lyrically delicate coffee, softly acidy, with orange, molasses, flowering grass and white wine notes. Clean, sweet, rich finish. Only a slight stiffening in the finish as the coffee cools holds this coffee back from an even higher rating.",, Apr 2007

93.0,Sumatra Blue Batak,"The aroma is shifting, complex: sweet, smoky candied fruit suggests lemon drop at one moment, butterscotch the next; hints of flowers, fresh-fallen wet leaves, even milk chocolate. The influence of the sweet musty/earthy notes on the tart fruit becomes more explicit in the rich, gently pungent cup, reading as a sort of earthy lemon and fresh leather. Medium-bodied, syrupy mouthfeel. Sweetly rich finish.",, Mar 2007
88.0,Misty Mornings,"Sweet-toned, deep aroma with gingery cedar and banana- and cherry-toned fruit notes and a hint of lemon at the top. In the cup big bodied, softly acidy, with very sweet, pungent fruit notes - grapefruit perhaps, and a spicy cedar. This deeply complex, quite attractive 90+ profile was marred by one bad cup: rubbery herb notes. I decided not to push down the rating too severely, given the originality and charm of the other four cups.",, Mar 2007
90.0,Special Reserve Rwanda Karaba Bourbon,"Sweet, rich, deep, pungently juicy aroma: cedar, oranges, banana, a hint of flowers. In the cup lean-bodied with a brightly pungent acidity, intensified floral notes, and a cocoa-chocolate cast to the fruit. The slightly dominating acidity softens in the finish, allowing the juicy orange and banana notes to bloom in a long, complex finale.",, Mar 2007
88.0,Costa Rica Orginal,"Sweet-toned, deeply pungent aroma with cedar and butter notes and a suggestion of bittersweet chocolate. In the cup rather lean-bodied, delicately and cleanly roasty, but with limited nuance: butter, hints of chocolate and flowers. The chocolate implicit throughout the profile emerges with surprising and pleasing clarity in the finish, outlasting even a slight astringency.",, Mar 2007
89.0,Blooming Blend,"Superb aroma: Richly and deeply fruity with floral top notes. In the small cup leanish but smooth mouthfeel, salty sweet, crisp, deeply cedary, with an apricot-toned semi-sweet chocolate. Rich but slightly astringent finish. Masters milk with dry power but without opulence.",Price: NA, Mar 2007
90.0,100% Kona Extra Fancy,"A simple but sweet, deeply resonant coffee with a big, smooth body and chocolate-toned fruit notes that read as a round, banana-inclined milk chocolate in the aroma. In the cup the chocolate turns toward cocoa and the fruit toward a gently tart, cherryish coffee fruit. Rich, straightforward finish with a very slight hint of astringency.",, Mar 2007
89.0,Aged Piko’s Peaberry,"A quiet but interesting coffee: soft, low-toned, with hints of cedar, warm spice, chocolate, and a low-acid fruit that suggests banana. The chocolate notes become more explicit in the impressively long, resonant finish.",, Mar 2007
85.0,Single Origin Dark Roast,"The ultra-dark roast turns mouthfeel lean, but spares us astringency and leaves us with a gently pungent, delicately rich cup with a shimmer of cardamom-toned spice and scorched cedar complication.",, Mar 2007
95.0,El Salvador Los Planes Cup of Excellence 2006,"Delicate, gently bright coffee with distinct, cedar-toned dry berry notes (the kind often called black currant) carrying from aroma to cup, support by cocoa, orange (perhaps better, tangerine) and floral nuance. The body is rather light, but the mouthfeel is gently lively, almost effervescent. Clean, rich finish with impressive flavor persistence, particularly of the orange/cocoa notes.",, Mar 2007
94.0,Huila El Palacio Colombia,"A deeply floral-toned coffee. The floral tones are rich and rose-like in both aroma and cup, with caramelly, almost custard-like support and hints of cedar and cocoa. The finish is sweet, deep and long.",, Mar 2007
88.0,Black Phantom Decaf Espresso,"Deeply rich aroma with fruity chocolate and cedar complication. In the small cup the cedar notes dominate, backgrounding the chocolate and fruit. Full body but slightly rough mouthfeel; rich and slightly sharp in the short finish, but in the long smoothes out nicely with a final memory of chocolate. The cedar and chocolate carry into milk, the cedar dominating but the chocolate-fruit side blooming nicely.",, Mar 2007
88.0,"Organic Fair-Trade Espresso, Swiss Water Decaf","Rather delicate, toasty aroma with hints of low-acid fruit - banana, chocolate. In the small cup medium to full body, with a crisply smoky, toasty character complicated by caramel and continued banana notes and a hint of flowers. The finish stays just on the rich side of rough. Rounds and blossoms in milk but remains roasty - think chocolate on toast - with a continued lean toward a banana-like fruit.",, Mar 2007
89.0,Transatlantic Decaf,"A tough, robust espresso. Sweetly and roundly smoky aroma with hints of semi-sweet chocolate. In the small cup full body with slightly rough mouthfeel, simple and richly pungent with continued hints of dark chocolate and a surprisingly clean, sweet finish. At its best in milk, where the semi-sweet chocolate rounds and dominates with minty richness.",, Mar 2007
89.0,Decaf Espresso Roast,"Lush in flavor but slightly lean in body and presence. Elegant blueberry- and chocolate-toned nose with a hint of cedar. In the small cup medium-bodied with a touch of sweet acidity and continued berry, cedar and dark chocolate notes. A bit thin-presenced in milk, though the sneakily persistent dark-chocolate, cherry-brandy opulence stays around nicely.",, Mar 2007
90.0,Dancing Goats Decaf,"Sweet-toned, very deep aroma with complication that reads as banana, orange, semi-sweet chocolate. In the small cup full bodied and cedar- and caramel-toned with continued suggestions of banana-like fruit and semi-sweet chocolate. The cedar and chocolate tones round and sweeten in milk without losing their crisp authority.",Price: NA, Mar 2007
89.0,PT’s Decaf Espresso Blend,"Balanced, versatile blend. Sweet-toned aroma with fruit and chocolate complications. In the small cup smooth and close to syrupy in mouthfeel, sweet and gently pungent with a pronounced cedar note and hints of prune and semi-sweet chocolate. Rich presence in milk - perhaps more cedar and mint than chocolate but roundly sweet nonetheless. Very slightly rough finish in both small cup and milk.",, Mar 2007
90.0,RayJen Roasters Reserve Decaf Espresso,"Deep but crisp aroma with impressive complexity: honey, caramel, semi-sweet chocolate, flowers, a hint of cedar. Medium to full body in the small cup with continued caramel and chocolate notes and pronounced, rather sharp cedar. In milk the chocolate rounds and blossoms sweetly, complicated by a continued crisp cedar and the reappearance of a floral shimmer at the top of the profile.",, Mar 2007
91.0,Detroit St. Decaf,"A versatile espresso with a pungent authority that should serve particularly well in big milk drinks. Slightly spicy, apricot- or mango-toned fruit in the deeply sweet-impressioned aroma. In the small cup displays full, syrupy body and a rather opulently sweet, chocolate-toned richness with a balancing cedar pungency. Slight astringency in the long finish. In milk rounds and blossoms nicely but dominates with semi-sweet chocolate authority and a slight but discernible astringent edge in the finish.",, Mar 2007
91.0,Fieldheads Espresso Decaf,"A quiet, complete espresso, short on drama but almost flawless in detail. Delicately complex aroma, with crisp chocolate and cedar and butter notes that together read much like butterscotch. In the small cup medium-bodied but very smooth in mouthfeel with almost no astringency and a sweet, chocolaty fruit and gentle cedar. Delicate but very sweet in milk with continued crisp chocolate and cedar notes and a cleanly rich finish.",, Mar 2007
92.0,"Decaf Espresso, Costa Rica La Lapa","Crisp, elegant espresso with dry berry and floral notes. Shows a hint of sweet, tomato-toned acidity in the aroma along with caramel and flowers. In the small cup surprisingly full-bodied with cedar, dry berry and a continuing shimmer of flowers. Clean, rich finish. Masters milk with a delicate, dry-chocolate-toned authority. The floral notes survive with startling clarity in milk, persisting far into the finish.",, Mar 2007
92.0,SWP Decaf Espresso,"Sweet-impressioned, deep aroma with a wonderfully candied, chocolaty tone to the fruit. In the small cup medium in body but smooth in mouthfeel with a deep cedar and continued candied fruit character. Surprisingly crisp, citrusy finish. Gentle and balanced in milk, blooming with milk chocolate and flowers, quiet but complete.",, Mar 2007
93.0,Decaf Roastmaster’s Choice Espresso,"A fine fruity-fermented style espresso in decaffeinated format. The sweet fermented fruit notes (I would guess from a dried-in-the-fruit East African green coffee component) read as blueberry with chocolate and ripe banana tones in both aroma and small cup. Excellent body, rich chocolate in the finish. A slight salty sensation that often accompanies fruity ferment hardly matters in the small cup, but seems to dampen sweetness in milk, where this exciting espresso doesn?t quite live up to its full chocolate-blueberry promise.",, Mar 2007
94.0,Decaf Organic Caffe Volcan,"A fine, versatile decaffeinated espresso particularly remarkable for its persistent floral top notes. In the aroma flowers, chocolate and apricot-toned fruit. In the small cup full body with perhaps a slightly rough mouthfeel, pungent, rich and balanced, with continuing semi-sweet chocolate and floral notes that carry into the finish. Blooms nicely in milk with minty chocolate sweetness while still maintaining the attractive floral and fruit complication.",, Mar 2007
94.0,Natural Decaf Espresso,"A powerful, fruitily complex, syrupy-bodied espresso. Candied fruit and distinct chocolate in the aroma. In the small cup heavy bodied; cedar and orangy fruit notes dominate, with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. At its best in milk, where it is rich, smooth-bodied and balanced, while maintaining a remarkable complexity and a distinct chocolate and spicy orange fruit character.",, Mar 2007
93.0,Kenya AA Gitugu Muranaa,"Quietly intense aroma, softly and sweetly high-toned, dry berry notes. In the cup medium-bodied with a silky mouthfeel, with the mild acidy edge and tart dry berry notes enveloped in sweetness, netting a floral, Riesling-like buoyancy.",, Feb 2007
88.0,Colombia Timana,"Round, rich aroma with distinct butter notes and hints of flowers and lemon. Simplifies in the cup: good body and a sweet, gently crisp structure, but little nuance.",, Feb 2007
89.0,"Organic Bolivian Coffee, Cumbre Supremo, New England Light Roast","Superb, richly sweet-toned aroma: semi-sweet chocolate with hints of raisins and cedar. In the cup rather lean-bodied, delicate, with crisp, very distinct cocoa-chocolate notes nuanced by hints of lemon, caramel, raisin.",, Feb 2007
89.0,"Organic, Fair-Trade Bolivia Caranavi","Soft, sweet-toned aroma with limited but pleasing nuance: cedar, perhaps tomato. Remains sweet in the cup, crisply delicate, with very pronounced sweet cocoa tones. Superb finish: sweet, long and cocoa-laced.",, Feb 2007
90.0,Colombia Huila Supremo,"Crisply sweet-toned aroma with cedar and butter notes. In the cup silky mouthfeel and a quiet, tight-knit complexity: distinct cocoa and hints of cedar, orange, flowers, butter. Smooth, gently rich, very persistent and pleasing finish.",, Feb 2007
90.0,Tres Santos Colombia,"Sweet-toned aroma with delicate floral-, cherry- and chocolate-toned fruit notes. In the cup more striking for its superb body and balanced structure than for its agreeable but limited nuance, a dry cherry-chocolate. The long, deep finish stays just on the rich side of astringent.",, Feb 2007
91.0,Peru Cochapampa Fair-Trade,"Rather thin aroma, with semi-sweet chocolate hints. In the cup the chocolate turns explicit, crisp and pleasantly cocoaish. The finish is surprisingly rich, with continued cocoa tones and a hint of flowers. The cup generally relaxes and plumps up as it cools.",, Feb 2007
91.0,Colombia Cup of Excellence Lot #8 Hato Viejo,"Very sweet-toned aroma with orange and pipe-tobacco notes. In the cup rich, wine-like acidity, syrupy mouthfeel, and a delicate yet rich structure with continued orange and fresh pipe-tobacco notes. Rich, long, sweet finish.",, Feb 2007
92.0,Pitalito Estate Colombian Supremo,"Pungent, buttery aroma with subtle but persistent floral notes. The cup is deep-toned and balanced, with syrupy body and continued floral top notes and buttery, chocolaty mid-notes. The elusive floral notes persist impressively in the long, rich finish.",, Feb 2007
92.0,Colombia Las Hermosas Medium Roast,"Sweet, delicate, floral-toned aroma with hints of lemon and a buttery chocolate. Reveals weight and power in the cup, with a rich acidity with continued floral, lemon and butter notes. Clean, rich finish.",, Feb 2007
93.0,Huila Typica San Agustin,"Sweetly tart aroma complicated by coffee fruit (think pie cherries) and hints of cedar and cocoa. The cup is dominated by a giddily sweet, buoyantly intense acidity with continued notes of fresh coffee fruit and flowers. Short but rich finish.",, Feb 2007
93.0,Colombia Tolima Cup of Excellence Presidential Award Winner El Placer,"Sweet-toned and alive with a dense, shifting complexity. Cedar, orange, distinct butterscotch, tomato, perhaps chocolate in the aroma. In the cup low-toned acidity and lightly syrupy in mouthfeel, with an almost sugary sweetness and tight-knit notes of butterscotch, caramel, honey, ripe but slightly tart orange. Rich and sweet in the short finish, though a slight hint of astringency surfaces in the long.",, Feb 2007
94.0,Colombia Hato Viejo Cup of Excellence,"A classic cup: pure, simple, intense, refined. Sweet-toned but crisp aroma: tomato, cedar, cardamom, chocolate. Richly and sweetly acidy in the cup with the classic complex of flowers and fresh coffee fruit with rounding hints of chocolate.",, Feb 2007
94.0,Colombia El Castillo Micro-Lot Nelson Melo,"An aromatically rather simple coffee with a tremendous relaxed and almost voluptuous structure. In the aroma low-toned and round with hints of flowers and cherry-toned fruit. Softly acidy and sweetly and deeply rich in the cup. Sweet, almost sugary finish.",, Feb 2007
94.0,"Colombia Cauca, Special Micro-Lot Selection Juvenal Penna","Sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: cherryish, chocolate-toned fruit with a hint of herby cedar. In the cup softly acidy and richly and exquisitely balanced, with the fruit taking on a distinct black cherry character. A coffee whose excellence ultimately lies in its suave authority and completeness.",, Feb 2007
94.0,Colombia Huila Supremo,"Quietly intense aroma, cedar and distinct butterscotch notes. Plushly heavy body in the sweet, deep-toned cup, with almost port-like red wine tones and rich hints of semi-sweet chocolate and roses anchored on a flinty, almost mineral-like base.",, Feb 2007
96.0,Colombia Tolima Reynel Perez Micro-Lot,"Exhilaratingly intense but roundly sweet-toned aroma: black cherry, flowers, milk chocolate, with an underlying cedar-toned crispness. Sweet flowers and cherry dominate in the cup with an almost symphonic richness of tone. Medium bodied but silky mouthfeel. The floral notes linger into the farthest reaches of the finish.",, Feb 2007
87.0,PBS Blend Organic Fair-Trade,"Rich, simple aroma: cedar and butter. In the cup agreeably deep-toned and round, with chocolate and continued butter notes. Good body, soft acidity. Continues consistent into the simple but sweet, rich finish.",, Feb 2007
92.0,Mocha Java,"Sweet, deep aroma with considerable intrigue: an herby, mentholated lemon, a hint of earth, distinct butter notes. In the cup softly acidy, silky in mouthfeel, voluptuously delicate yet subtly brusque, with cocoa notes and perhaps a continuing hint of butter. The finish is rich and sweet.",, Feb 2007
92.0,Kenya AA,"Intense, complex, yet balanced aroma: chocolate, caramel, cedar, flowers, tomato. In the cup the acidity is powerful but juicily sweet, the flavor alive with shifting hints of flowers, citrus and wine. Long, gently astringent finish.",, Feb 2007
75.0,Morning Cafe,"Pungently sweet, cedary, faintly sewerish-fermented aroma. In the cup neutral, sweet, very simple, with hints of walnut and continued composty ferment. Cleans up a bit in the finish. Considerable difference from cup to cup, with some cups more fermented than others.",, Jan 2007
76.0,Yuban Organic,"Cloyingly sweet, earthy/mildewed character with very distinct grassy notes.",, Jan 2007
78.0,MJB Premium Coffee,"Sweet wood and vegetal cocoa in the aroma. In the cup flatly bittersweet, continued woody, with a hint of vegetal cocoa that stays just on the cocoa side of rubbery. Simple, short, salty/sweet finish.",, Jan 2007
81.0,Maxwell House Original,"Very sweet aroma, with nut and perhaps slight floral and chocolate notes. In the cup cloyingly bittersweet wood and nut robusta character with continued faint chocolate and floral suggestions.",, Jan 2007
79.0,"Yuban Original, 30% Rainforest Alliance Certified","The aroma is sweet but neutral and thin, with wood, caramel and nut notes. In the cup caramelly with a hint of cedar, but dominated by a cloyingly sweet nut character, the calling card of inexpensive coffees of the robusta species.",, Jan 2007
82.0,French Roast,"Smoky aroma dominated by scorched cedar notes with hints of spice and orange. In the sharply pungent, faintly sweet cup all grace notes vanish with the exception of the smoky, scorched cedar. Good sweetness in the short finish, with only slight astringency in the long.",, Jan 2007
84.0,Great Value 100% Arabica,"Rather subdued aroma, but quite sweet and deep, with floral, semi-sweet chocolate and cherry hints. Continued round and deep in the cup, with distinct semi-sweet chocolate notes and a slight woody, herby edge. The round richness carries into the short finish but gives way to a shallow, salty woodiness in the long.",, Jan 2007
84.0,Sumatra,"Attractive aroma: sweet, gently scorched cedar with a distinct hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Very roasty in the cup, but with patience the sweet burned notes round toward a vague, caramelly chocolate. Simple and sweet in the short finish, mildly astringent in the long.",, Jan 2007
84.0,Lively Colombian,"Sweet, round but crisp profile. Attractive nuance in the aroma - raisin, cedar, pipe tobacco, a hint of chocolate - fades quickly in the cup, leaving behind only the faintest shimmer of floral-toned chocolate. Sweet, distantly chocolate-toned finish, but quite astringent in the mouthfeel.",, Jan 2007
85.0,Kona Coffee Blend Light Roast,"Subdued, sweet-toned aroma: cedar, hints of chocolate and prune-toned fruit. Round, simple, and rather richly bittersweet in the cup, with some hints of flowers, chocolate and prune. Deep, resonant short finish thins toward astringency in the long.",, Jan 2007
87.0,African Kitamu,"A very interesting profile, shallow in depth of sensation but intensely complex within that narrow range. Crisply roasty but lively aroma with sweet apple and floral-toned chocolate notes. Continued roasty in the cup with distinct, sweetly lemony fruit and continued hints of flowers and chocolate.",, Jan 2007
87.0,Major Dickason’s Blend,"Very rich, deep, balanced aroma with hints of cedar, orangy fruit and semi-sweet chocolate. Rather fat-bodied in the cup, with continuing hints of flowers, dark chocolate, and a pungent citrus that I read as grapefruit. A distractingly sharp, astringent mouthfeel rounds and softens as the cup cools, but continues to dominate in the finish.",, Jan 2007
87.0,Between Roast,"A quiet, sweetly rounded coffee. Cherry and a hint of chocolate in the aroma, softly acidy and rather full-bodied in the cup, with candied walnut, cacao and pipe tobacco notes. Simple, gently rich finish.",Price: NA, Jan 2007

96.0,Kenyan AA,"A coffee at once voluptuous and austere. Delicately complex aroma: flowers, chocolate, tobacco leaf, lemon grass. In the cup an amazingly rich, wine-like acidity, sweet flowers, and a gently crisp, dry berry fruit. Hints of chocolate re-emerge in the cleanly long, almost perfect finish.",, Dec 2006
92.0,Panama La Esmeralda Geisha,"Very sweet-toned, exquisitely balanced aroma with floral, candied lemon and sweet herb notes. In the cup intense, tartly sweet acidity and buoyant mouthfeel with white wine and continued sweet lemon notes. The barest hint of chocolate in the cup blooms with soft explicitness in the surprisingly sweet finish. The cup stiffens ever so slightly as it cools.",, Dec 2006
90.0,El Salvador Santa Sofia,"Dark chocolate and caramel in the aroma. Luscious body, cherry-laced dark chocolate in the cup.",, Dec 2006
91.0,El Salvador Montenegro,"Cocoa and caramel aroma. Blazing acidity, dark chocolate and caramel, regal balance. A nicely conducted, relatively light roast makes this balanced but assertive coffee particularly well-suited for vacuum pot and drip brewing.",, Dec 2006
91.0,Nicaragua Los Vasques,Crisply acidy but big-bodied and lavishly chocolate-toned. Vanilla bean complicates the chocolate in the finish. A tactful match of roast to coffee.,, Dec 2006

95.0,Panama Esmeralda Especial,"Spectacularly aromatic in both dry and infused aroma: candied lemon peel, bergamot, hints of jasmine. Medium bodied and sweet, with superb acidity and flavors that suggest both the mentholated citrus of a Yirgacheffe and the blueberry notes of a Harrar, but without a trace of ferment or earthiness. Perfumed perfection.",Price: NA, Dec 2006
95.0,El Salvador Pacamara Los Planes,"Cocoa laced with citrus in the aroma. Flavors are as complex and sculpted as a top Alsatian Riesling, with intense lemon and orange acidity, chocolate, and a suggestion of fresh chive or tarragon always associated with this variety.  A powerful, aristocratic grand cru. This fragile, low-density variety is a major challenge to roast (and cannot handle dark roasting); this is a particularly masterful roasting job.",, Dec 2006
96.0,El Salvador Los Planes Pacamara,"Chocolate and citrus on the break. Regal acidity, complex flavors of chocolate, citrus and herbs. A powerful, intense and demanding cup. Haunting, persistent finish. Perfect roast of this especially challenging bean. What great coffee is all about.",, Dec 2006
86.0,Organic Nicaragua Jinotega,"Deep, sweetly pungent aroma: cedar, banana-like fruit, a hint of flowers. Big-bodied in the cup, with continued pungently sweet character and limited nuance, mainly cedar and some cedar-toned chocolate. Simple but rich in the finish.",, Nov 2006
88.0,100 Percent Kona,"Sweetly pungent aroma with hints of chocolate, cedar, low-acid fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup medium-bodied but silky in mouthfeel, with great sweetness, a roast-muted tartness, elegant floral notes and coffee fruit turned toward cocoa under the influence of the roast. Rich, sweet and cocoa-toned in the short finish, rather astringent in the long.",, Nov 2006
89.0,Sulawesi Toraja,"Intense, gently pungent aroma with great, low-toned complexity: vanilla, honey, caramel, banana, semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup a heavy bittersweetness and rough mouthfeel initially dominate, but as the cup begins to cool a honeyish sweetness and rich semi-sweet chocolate emerge and persist into the finish.",, Nov 2006
89.0,Panama Lot 13 Special Reserve,"Delicate, lyrically sweet-toned aroma with flowers, flowering grass and a lush shimmer of molasses. In the cup delicate but intense, with sweetly tart, white-wine-toned acidity, light-bodied but silky mouthfeel, and continued fresh, aromatic grass notes. Surprisingly rich in the short finish with a shadow of grassy astringency in the long.",, Nov 2006
86.0,Holiday Blend,"Very sweet-toned aroma with a round, banana-like fruit and hints of fresh-cut cedar, flowers, and sweet spice. Remains sweet in the cup with a sort of banana-bread molasses-and-fruit character, but the roast impact is lean and a touch bitterish. Rich short finish, slightly heavy long.",, Nov 2006
87.0,Holiday Blend,"Rather muted, mildly sweet, gingerbready aroma. Plumps up nicely in the cup, however: full-bodied, round, deep, with toasty caramel and fat, banana-toned fruit. Cleanly rich, sweet finish.",, Nov 2006
88.0,Holiday Blend,"Sweetly smoky, fruity aroma. In the cup light to medium body with a silky mouthfeel and quiet balance between a gentle acidity and a discreetly roast (cedar and toast) character. A hint of dark chocolate in the cup and butterscotch in the simple but rich finish.",, Nov 2006
88.0,Holiday Blend 2006,"Sweet-toned, gently roasty aroma with distinct grapefruit notes and the barest hints of cedar and chocolate. In the cup the roast tones are sharper but still sweet, reading even more clearly as a richly pungent grapefruit with a slight chocolate cast. Deep finish with almost no astringency. A slight unevenness from cup to cup brought down the rating of this fundamentally distinguished dark-roasted coffee.",, Nov 2006
90.0,Original Christmas,"An exhilarating and intense blueberry and wine character dominates the profile from aroma to finish. In the aroma the blueberry and wine tones are particularly pure and sweet. In the cup things grow more complicated: the blueberry takes a chocolate turn and the wine may strike some palates as too aggressively fermented. The finish is even more ambiguous, as the blueberry fruit persists nicely but takes a slightly soapy, salty direction. There are some coffee professionals who would give this unorthodox coffee a rating of 95; others would throw it off the table at 75.",, Nov 2006
90.0,Kenya Karindundu Nyeri,"An intense coffee dominated from aroma through finish by a rich, tartly sweet acidity and high-toned lemon and dry berry notes. The finish, like the entire profile, is as deeply sweet as it is uncompromisingly dry.",, Nov 2006
92.0,Ethiopia Kaffa Forest,"Very complete aroma: pungently acidy but sweet-toned, with fat banana-like fruit and chocolate hints. In the cup gently round, rich acidity, medium body, silky mouthfeel, and distinct orange, lavender and fresh pipe tobacco notes with a little chocolate lean toward the finish. Excellent flavor persistence in the long, complex finish.",, Nov 2006
93.0,Anniversary Blend,"A quietly exotic, complex blend of impressive originality. Smoothly midtoned, gently pungent aroma. In the cup displays lively, almost peppery acidity and full body with some tingle in the mouthfeel. Lyrically and richly sweet, with a wine-like, black grapey hint of ferment and a slight musty-malty edge. A surprising shimmer of flowers in the long finish.",, Nov 2006
96.0,Kenya Mamuto Kirinyaga,"Vividly lively yet elegantly smooth coffee. Intense aroma with tart cherry and round, low-acid fruit notes, banana perhaps, with hints of fresh leather. In the cup sweet, lyric acidity, light but silky mouthfeel, cherry and cocoa notes. Rich, sweet, deeply long finish.",, Nov 2006
87.0,Idee Kaffee Classic,"In the aroma sweet-toned, gently rich, with distinct cocoa, or perhaps carob, tones and hints of fresh-cut wood and vanilla. In the cup quite heavy in body. Bittersweet with continued low-key notes that read as a spicy, vegetal chocolate (cocoa or carob) with vanilla and floral top notes. The cocoa/carob notes persist in the long, sweetly pleasant finish. Very slight astringency.",, Oct 2006
88.0,Autumn Harvest Blend Organic Fair Trade,"Sweet-toned, deep aroma with a tight-knit complexity: dried cherry, raisin, moist leaves. Almost syrupy sweet in the cup, with a slight roasty edge. The dried cherry and raisin-toned fruit take on a port-wine richness before settling toward chocolate in the richly bittersweet finish.",, Oct 2006
87.0,Organic Espresso Blend Fair Trade,"(Tested as roasted - rather dark - by the Swiss Water Decaffeinated Coffee.) Complex aroma: toast, banana-toned fruit, semi-sweet chocolate, perhaps a hint of tomato. In the small cup quite light-bodied though smooth in mouthfeel; very sweet, with a richly fruity character that continues to suggest banana and a prune-toned, semi-sweet chocolate, all of which carries elegantly into a rich finish. Rather lean and limited in milk, however; the chocolate and fruit notes are attractive but fail to bloom.",, Oct 2006
87.0,SWISS WATER House Blend,"(Tested as roasted - rather dark - by Swiss Water Decaffeinated Coffee Company.) Very sweet-toned, gently roasty aroma, with peach-toned cedar and semi-sweet chocolate notes. Simplifies in the cup, but remains delicately sweet and balanced with continuing dry chocolate complication. Gently rich finish with the barest hint of astringency as the cup cools.",, Oct 2006
86.0,Belo Espresso,"Sweet-toned aroma but rather quiet: raisin, dark chocolate, walnut, floral complication. In the small cup substantial body, smooth mouthfeel, salty-sweet, with continuing dark chocolate and walnut notes. Substantial presence in milk, though subdued and simple.",, Oct 2006
87.0,Classico Italian Roast,"A mid-toned, gently crisp coffee. Rich aroma with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, walnut, perhaps orange complication. In the cup, full though slightly rough body with a continued dry, semi-sweet chocolate character and hints of walnut and orangy raisin. Rich, simple, slightly heavy finish.",, Oct 2006
86.0,Marques de Paiva Gourmet Fair Trade Espresso Roast,"Fine, delicate aroma: sweet-toned with floral top notes and a hint of dark chocolate. In the small cup medium-bodied and sweet but rather simple: some continued dark chocolate notes and raisiny fruit. In milk remains sweetly delicate and restrained.",, Oct 2006
88.0,Big Truck,"Very sweet-toned aroma with spice (nutmeg?) and toast notes. In the small cup full bodied and slightly rough in mouthfeel, bittersweet with toast, cedar and chocolate hints.

In milk lean-bodied but lush, dominated by a smoky semi-sweet chocolate.",, Oct 2006
89.0,Demitasse Espresso,"Sweet-toned, roundly balanced aroma with overlapping hints of apricot, cedar and milk chocolate. Medium-bodied in the small cup, crisp, almost sharp, with continued suggestions of apricot, cedar and milk chocolate. At its best in milk, which softens the sharpness without dampening authority, allowing the fruit and chocolate to bloom with gently luxury?",, Oct 2006
89.0,Ethiopian Hache,"Sweet, lyric fruit in the aroma: cherry, chocolate-toned blueberry. The fruit mutes in the small cup but the underlying structure is pleasing: rich, intense, medium-bodied and silky in mouthfeel. The berry notes carry into the slightly heavy finish. The blueberry character fattens nicely in milk, though the chocolate side of the flavor complex remains a bit tight and restrained.",, Oct 2006
90.0,Hair Bender Espresso,"Smoke, toast and a hint of flowers in the aroma. In the small cup medium-bodied and smooth in mouthfeel, balanced, rich, simple, with hints of cedar, dark chocolate and toast. Sweet finish.

90.0,Super Tuscan Espresso,"Superbly and naturally sweet espresso. Complex in the aroma: caramel, milk chocolate, hints of nuts, flowers, pear-toned fruit. In the small cup medium-bodied but very smooth, gently pungent, with semi-sweet chocolate and a hint of smoke. Very sweet finish, long and cleanly rich. Fills out milk nicely with plump semi-sweet chocolate and a continued slight smoky, pungent edge.",, Oct 2006
90.0,Espresso,"A big, muscular espresso. Smoky, sweet-toned aroma with hints of apricot-toned chocolate. The massive body and syrupy if slightly astringent mouthfeel tend to overwhelm the chocolaty fruit in demitasse and finish, but all turns out well in milk, where the body remains fat and the chocolate blooms deeply and darkly.",, Oct 2006
90.0,90 Mile Stretch Espresso,"Very sweet-toned aroma with floral hints. In the small cup medium-bodied and slightly lean in mouthfeel, crisp, cedary, with raisiny, licorice-toned fruit. Slightly heavy finish but excellent flavor persistence, with the fruit turning toward chocolate. Comes into its own in milk, where it is balanced and roundly rich, with deep semi-sweet chocolate character.",, Oct 2006
90.0,Private Reserve Espresso,"Suave, cedar- and chocolate-toned aroma with floral top notes. In the small cup medium-bodied, rich, and very smoothly and sweetly cedar-toned. The chocolate and flowers return to complicate the cedar in the long, round finish. In milk rather lean in mouthfeel but expansively chocolaty with a continued suggestion of flowers.",, Oct 2006
90.0,Yirgacheffe Single-Origin Espresso,A delicate but intense lemony chocolate dominates from aroma through demitasse to milk. The lemon-toned chocolate is lavish and sweet in the aroma; in the small cup tartly sweet; in finish pleasantly persistent despite a slight astringency. In milk the lemon mutes while the chocolate rounds out lushly.,, Oct 2006
91.0,Dolce Terra Organic Espresso,"Straightforward aroma with caramel and apricot-toned fruit. In the small cup syrupy and round, with a gentle fruit-toned cedar character and a mild musty-malty edge. Rich finish with a slight astringency.

91.0,Espresso,"A gently pungent complex of tart berry and semi-sweet chocolate runs through the small cup with brisk authority from aroma to finish. The berry and chocolate notes blossom beautifully in milk, softening and rounding without losing energy or character.",, Oct 2006
91.0,Espresso Havana,"Lovely, high-toned aroma: flowers, orange, fresh cedar. In the small cup medium in body, lightly syrupy in mouthfeel, and cleanly and richly lively: The cedar character moves forward and the orange takes on a slight chocolate cast. Rich finish with good flavor persistence. In milk delicate, straightforward, crisply sweet.",, Oct 2006
85.0,Vermont Country Blend Decaf K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Delicate, caramel-toned aroma: flowers, berries, chocolate.

Sweet and rich in the short finish; turns slightly woody in the long.",, Sep 2006
85.0,Lake and Lodge K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Smoke, toast, caramel, prune-toned fruit in the aroma. In the cup rich, low-key, with continued toast and pruny fruit notes and a hint of flowers.",, Sep 2006
88.0,Breakfast Blend K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Shifting, complex, sweet-toned aromatics: distinct butter and caramel notes, with suggestions of peach, walnut and flowering grass. In the cup very sweet, and delicately but assertively acidy. Think tartly sweet green apples. Continued peach and floral nuance in the rich but quickly fading finish.",, Sep 2006
88.0,Vermont Country Blend K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): In the aroma buttery and round with low-acid fruit, apple perhaps, and a hint of flowers at the top. Softly acidy. The aromatics consolidate in the cup but remain quietly rich through the short finish, though they fade quickly in the long.",, Sep 2006
87.0,Nantucket Blend K-Cup,"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Delicately complex aromatics: suggestions of flowers, chocolate, peach, sweet orange, all of which take on a Riesling-like sweetness and delicacy in nose and cup. Gently bright acidity. Fades rather quickly in the finish.",, Sep 2006
87.0,Sumatran Reserve Fair Trade Organic (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Smoke and earth notes in the aroma are brightened by a hint of floral-toned vanilla. In the cup, low-toned acidity, substantial body, and continued smoke, earth and floral notes rounded by a quiet caramel sweetness.",, Sep 2006
87.0,"Guatemala Huehuetenango El Limonar Estate, Dark Roast","Intense, deeply rich aroma dominated by cedar notes with hints of plum or prune that lean toward semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup smooth and substantial in mouthfeel, powerful and balanced, but limited in nuance. Like the cup, the finish is structurally impressive (rich, clean) but simple.",, Sep 2006
78.0,Original Blend,"(Pre-ground coffee and roasted soy) The aroma is rich, rather deep, with notes that suggest a nut-toned chocolate. In the cup, however, an intense, rather cloying sweetness overlays an equally intense astringency, complicated by woody nut notes, unsalted peanuts perhaps.",, Sep 2006
80.0,New Mexico Pinon Coffee,"(Whole-bean blend of coffee and roasted pi?on nuts) Very full nose with a sort of toasted apple and cinnamon character plus an odd, cloyingly sweet woodiness. In the cup quite full-bodied with a continued dominating sweet, soapy wood character overriding pleasant chocolate, molasses and perhaps apple and lemon notes.",, Sep 2006
81.0,Abyssinian Blend,"(Pre-ground blend of coffee, cardamom and cinnamon) The spice sensation is intense and dominating throughout the profile, reading as a bitter, resiny orange with a sharp cinnamon overlay. In the cup the mouthfeel is full and the taste simultaneously sweet and brassily bitter.",, Sep 2006
82.0,Madagascar Blend,"(Pre-ground blend of coffee, dry honey and vanilla) Oddly muted aroma dominated by notes that read as a dry, caroby chocolate. Very sweet, sugary, cup with a limiting, drying astringency. The same combination of intense sweetness and heavy astringency marks the finish.",, Sep 2006
84.0,Royal Vanilla,"(Whole-bean coffee flavored with natural anise and vanilla extracts on an alcohol base) Intense anise character dominates in the aroma. When I cupped this coffee blind before it was identified for me, I read the anise as a combination of licorice and caraway seed and the vanilla as chocolate. In the cup the anise continues to dominate sharply, overpowering the softer vanilla-cum-chocolate notes. The vanilla/chocolate finally prevails over the sharp anise in the pleasant long finish.",, Sep 2006
85.0,Coffee and Chicory,"(Pre-ground coffee and roasted chicory root) Strong chicory character in the aroma (woody, peppery prune). In the cup quite sweet, with continued, rather complex chicory influence: peppery prune, aromatic wood, hints of flowers and lemon. The fruit character is particularly pronounced in the tingly and perhaps cloyingly sweet finish.",, Sep 2006
85.0,Chocatal: Cocoa Nibs and Organic Coffee,"(Pre-ground blend of coffee and cocoa nibs) Sweet-toned aroma dominated by what reads as nut (walnut?) notes with suggestions of chocolate and dried fruit, perhaps raisin. In the cup round and full in mouthfeel and gently acidy but limited in aromatic range, with a continued dominant nut character and sweet chocolate undercurrents that fade in the slightly tight finish.",, Sep 2006
86.0,Big Easy Coffee with Chicory,"(Pre-ground coffee and roasted chicory root) Chicory strongly influences but does not dominate the coffee in this rather lively blend. In the aroma warm, spicy fruit and aromatic wood notes. Brightly and sweetly acidy in the cup, with a gentle, peppery lemon complication. The chicory has the last, tingling word in the finish.",, Sep 2006
87.0,Aztec Chocolate,"(Whole-bean coffee flavored with natural chocolate and habanero chile extracts on an alcohol base) The flavorings seem discreet and resonate well with the coffee, particularly in the quietly deep aroma. The chocolate reads as the semisweet kind with a dry walnut character; the chile is felt more than tasted, particularly in the warm, gently tingly finish.",, Sep 2006
89.0,Le Fou Frog Blend,"(Pre-ground coffee and roasted chicory root) Bright, gently acidy aroma with distinct lemon notes and a hint of raisiny chocolate. In the cup delicately lively with a slight spicy, peppery character and clear lemon and floral top notes. Clean, rich finish.",, Sep 2006
90.0,Black Flag Espresso,"Cocoa, banana and a hint of cedar in the fine aroma. In the small cup big-bodied, gently and sweetly pungent, with a rich, orange-toned cedar character and cocoa notes that round toward chocolate. Rich short finish, very slightly astringent in the long, but sweet chocolate suggestions persist throughout. Remains in sturdy control in milk, though it never quite sweetens and blossoms.",, Aug 2006
86.0,Black Apron Exclusive Kopi Kampung Sulawesi,"Hints of banana-toned fruit, chocolate, fresh-baked bread in the complex but rather listless aroma. Thin though silky mouthfeel. Pungent, gently burned cedar character in the cup, with floral and caramelly chocolate suggestions. Nicely malty finish, but a hint of burned building rubber.",, Aug 2006
88.0,Roastmaster’s Reserve Volcan Tacana,"Orange, raisiny chocolate, and pungent herbal notes in the aroma. Delicate in the cup, with continued orange-chocolate and pungent herb notes. Slightly bitter in the short finish, but smoothes out and sweetens nicely in the long.",, Aug 2006
89.0,Special Reserve Ethiopian Sidamo Natural Process,"A sweet fruit ferment contributes to an intense aromatic complexity that carries from nose to cup: Spicy, rose-like flowers, honey, blueberry, ripe peach, a hint of chocolate. The finish is rich and blueberry-toned, but cup and finish both stiffen just a bit as the coffee cools, revealing a hint of heavy astringency.",, Aug 2006
89.0,"Private Reserve Nicaraguan Las Nubes, Cup of Excellence","Nut, prune, cedar and citrus, perhaps grapefruit, in the rich, low-toned aroma. Very sweet in the cup, pungent, with continued walnut and citrus notes and suggestions of earth or moist leaves. Everything settles toward chocolate in the rich finish. The cup roughens very slightly as it cools.",, Aug 2006
90.0,Costa Rica Brumas del Zurqui,"Intense aroma: tart cherry, caramel, hints of lemon, flowers, chocolate. In the cup delicate and pure: brings the fresh, dusky floral and tart cherry notes of coffee flowers and fruit into the cup with continuing hints of chocolate and lemon. The finish is clean, simple, ingenuous.",, Aug 2006
91.0,Colombia El Lechal Cup of Excellence,"A whisper of an aroma, but a complex one: flowering grass, caramel, honey, a hint of chocolate. Amazingly sweet and delicately lush in the cup, with the honey notes intensifying and the floral notes declaring as spicy tea rose. The honey and floral notes persist in the surprisingly long, resonant finish.",, Aug 2006
91.0,Panama Esmerald Especial,"Cherry notes dominate in the very sweet-toned, pungently acidy aroma. Relatively light-bodied in the cup, but sweetly and buoyantly acidy, with striking and complex aromatic notes: cherry, tea rose, Meyer Lemon, orange, honey. Honey in particular persists in the rich, sweet, though slightly astringent finish.",, Aug 2006
91.0,Colombian Dos Quebradas Special Reserve Cup of Excellence,"A deep, spicy floral character - dusk flowers, tea rose - leads in aroma and cup, supported by low-acid fruit notes - peach, cherry - and hints of milk chocolate and leather. The acidity is deep-toned and round, the finish rich and clean.",, Aug 2006
91.0,Kenya Kithua Estates,"Pungent but sweet throughout the profile. In the aroma caramel, fruit-toned, slightly smoky cedar, orange. In the cup the pungent, smoky fruit notes read as a tartly sweet grapefruit, perhaps dry berry, with continuing undercurrents of caramel sweetness. Distinct orange notes resurface in the rich finish.",, Aug 2006
91.0,Ethiopia Chichu,"Powerful, sweet-toned aroma: cherry, honey, tea-rose, milk chocolate, with a very mild ferment that reads as delicate Riesling-like wine. In the cup the honey and rose-like floral notes persist lushly, with the fruit notes turning from dark cherry to a tarter coffee fruit. The felicitous ferment deepens, reading more as brandy than wine. The finish is rich and deep, with an attractive persistence of flower, cherry and honey, but is weighed by the astringent heaviness usual with even the best of this style of dry-processed coffee.",, Aug 2006
93.0,Kenya Karindundu,"Intense, lyrically sweet coffee: honey, flowers and the pure notes of coffee fruit carry from aroma to cup; the acidity is tart but caramelly, even buttery. Impeccably clean, delicately rich finish.",, Aug 2006
94.0,Sumatra Lake Tawar,"In the aroma intense, pungent with grapefruit and cedar notes. In the cup full-bodied, with the dominating earthy pungency enveloped in deep sweetness. Continued grapefruit, pineapple and cedar notes settle toward honey and chocolate. Sweet, resonant, rich finish, totally free of astringency.",Price: NA, Aug 2006
94.0,Sumatra Lake Tawar,"Tartly sweet fruit notes suggest pineapple, grapefruit or perhaps black currant in the aroma, with delicate undercurrents of caramel and earth. In the cup the musty/malty earth notes move richly forward, backgrounding the continuing crisp, pineapply fruit. A slight astringency in the short finish gives way to sweetness and pineapple in the long.",, Aug 2006
87.0,"Mahled Gahfae Thai Arabica, City Roast","In the aroma richly pungent with low-toned, rather subdued nuance: hints of banana, cedar, date perhaps. In the cup quiet, balanced, bittersweet, with faint whispers of nutmeg, raw date, butter, aromatic wood, all persisting into the rich finish.",, Jul 2006
88.0,Pitalito Swiss Water Decaf,"Roses, milk chocolate and a hint of aromatic wood in the aroma. Crisp and richly delicate in the cup, with continued hints of aromatic wood, spicy rose and a sweet chocolate. The finish is simple but clean and rich.",, Jul 2006
85.0,Breakfast Blend,"Co-cupper Danny O'Neill calls this coffee ""a solid cup, well-balanced ... fruity up the middle"" (84). Ken found it balanced as well, though he reads the fruit as ""a dry, fruit-toned chocolate that wants to be rich but is a bit too lean and simple"" (85). Both were disappointed by a mildly astringent finish.",, Jul 2006
85.0,Fair-Trade Breakfast Blend,"Both co-cupper Danny O'Neill (83) and Ken (87) admired an aroma that was ""sweet and spicy"" for Danny, ""rich, deep and sweetly smoky"" for Ken. For Danny the cup was ""muddled"" and woody, for Ken slightly astringent in structure but nevertheless pleasantly bittersweet with a rich cocoa character that strengthened as the coffee cooled.",, Jul 2006
85.0,Organic Breakfast Blend,"A sweet musty character that can read anywhere from malty chocolate to damp basement depending on context and cupper animated this blend. Co-cupper Danny O'Neill (86) was more positive than Ken (83), citing ""the sweet chocolaty aroma of fresh brownies"" in the aroma and ""a delicate balance of mild acidity and smooth buttery body"" in the cup with ""lingering fruity nuances"" in the finish. Ken felt the cup was fundamentally sweet and rather rich, but objected to a ""woody, baggy"" character nuanced by only ""the barest hints of raisins and chocolate"" in the cup.",, Jul 2006
86.0,Daybreak Morning Blend,"Both co-cupper Danny O'Neill (85) and Ken (87) read foresty notes in the aroma: ""fresh greenery and earth"" for Danny, ""cacao and tree bark"" for Ken. The cup was both balanced and quite complex, with fruit notes (""cherry toned"" for Ken, ""ripe apple and berry"" for Danny) combining with continued forest notes that suggested dried flowers or herbs.",, Jul 2006
86.0,African Summer Blend,"An exciting coffee that disappoints in the finish. Ken (88) was more forgiving than co-cupper Danny O'Neill (83), who sums up: ""Bright and clean in the nose, this coffee's lusciously thick and smooth body rounds its slightly fruity, almost wine-like, acidity. Sweet honey and fruit flavors become sharp and  ... astringent in the long finish.""  Perhaps the dry-processed Ethiopias in this blend are last year's crop, with their explosive aromatics too faded to compensate for an underlying mildly astringent structure.",, Jul 2006
88.0,Breakfast Blend,"Superb aroma: ""sultry and exotic"" for co-cupper Danny O'Neill; ""richly complex"" for Ken, with ""milk chocolate, sweet tomato, apricot and cedar"" notes. Both Danny (87) and Ken (88) admired the quiet complexity and balance of the cup; ""gently bittersweet and chocolaty"" for Ken, ""dark and smoky"" for Danny. Both noted a slight hardening of the cup as it cooled.",, Jul 2006
89.0,Kansas Sunrise Blend,"Complex aromatics: flowers, pear, hints of brandy and cherry in the aroma. In the cup delicately acidy, roundly supple in mouthfeel, with a continued complex fruit that co-cupper Danny O'Neill (87) read as sweet raisin and Ken (more elaborately at 91) as dried cherry, fresh pear, brandy and flowers. Rich though surprisingly short-lived finish.",, Jul 2006
90.0,Madrugada,"Co-cupper Danny O'Neill read ""rich chocolaty pudding"" in the superb aroma. Ken's reading was more conventional though just as positive: flowers, oranges, chocolate, cherry. Both admired the complex fruity character of the cup: ""bouquet of fruity melon and apple"" for Danny (88); ""tart but rich cherry, hints of plum and orange"" for Ken (91). ""Finishes clean with lingering hints of late summer"" (Danny).",, Jul 2006
90.0,Breakfast Blend,"Co-cupper Danny O'Neill and Ken both admired this coffee's sweet floral- and chocolate-toned aroma, cleanly bright (Danny) acidity and silky body. Danny (89) cited its quintessential balance, Ken (90) a ""delicate, restrained giddiness"" animated by floral, apple and pear notes.",, Jul 2006
91.0,Breakfast Blend,"Both Ken (92) and co-cupper Danny O'Neill (90) admired this coffee's classic completeness. ""Smooth body ...Clean, fruity and well-balanced ...the whole package"" for Danny. Ken was particularly impressed by the cup's ""lushly sweet"" acidity and complexity that for him suggested caramel, chocolate, molasses and a hint of flowers at the top. Ken was sufficiently impressed by the virtues of the cup to overlook a very slight astringency in the long finish.",, Jul 2006
86.0,Sumatra Fair-Trade Organic,"Deeply roasty aroma: cedar, cardamom, caramel, raisin, a hint of flowers. In the cup sweet, almost syrupy with continued caramel, raisin and floral complication. A sharp astringency shadows the cup, however, and grows in intensity as the coffee cools. The short finish is cedary and rich, but fades toward a nagging astringency in the long. Reader Sheri Flagler is a fan and regular customer of Beanstock Roasters.",, Jun 2006
86.0,Black Apron Exclusive Kopi Kampung Sulawesi,"Very sweet-toned, quietly complex aroma: smoke, semi-sweet chocolate and tart berryish fruit notes. Little of the aromatic complexity survives in the lean-bodied cup, only wisps of nut and crisp, smoky chocolate that fade quickly in the finish, leaving behind faint sweetness and a muted astringency.",, Jun 2006
87.0,SLO Roasted Coffee Morning Fog Lifter,"The aroma is dominated by a very sweet scorched cedar and a spicy banana-toned fruit. Both carry nicely into the cup, which retains sweetness and a relatively rich mouthfeel despite the very dark roast. In the finish the sweet roastiness manages to outlast a slight astringency. One reader calls this the ""best coffee I've ever had.""",, Jun 2006
88.0,Monte Crisol Costa Rican Tarrazu,"In the aroma cedar plus flowers and roast-influenced caramel and banana notes. A roast-muted acidity gently lifts the cup, where the cedar and caramel notes persist while the banana-toned fruit notes drift toward chocolate. Quiet short finish with a slight astringency in the long. Reader Ed Escobar says he has been ""impressed by the consistent quality and freshness"" of the coffees he has been buying from Old Bisbee Roasters.",, Jun 2006
88.0,Organic Guatemala,"A cup either pleasingly delicate or disappointingly simple depending on taste and expectation. Balanced, gentle aroma with a very fresh, foresty cedar and a suggestion of pear-toned fruit. In the cup the cedar and fruit tones finally settle into a sweet, raisin-toned chocolate. Reader Laura Cheng nominated another Central American coffee from Caffe Vita that was not available, so we took the liberty of ordering this one instead.",, Jun 2006
88.0,"Omar’s Organic Blend, Fair-Trade","Gently pungent cedar and pear-toned fruit in the aroma. In the cup sweetly and richly acidy with a continued pungent edge that hints at chocolate. The long, robust-on-the-edge-of-rough finish suggests that the attractive pungency of the profile may in part be powered by a slight, felicitous mustiness in one of the blend's green coffees.",, Jun 2006
88.0,Colombia Los Lirios Cup of Excellence,"Fine aroma: high-toned, elegant, combining suggestions of flowers, lemon, cedar and peach in a single suave, tight-knit aromatic gesture. In the cup delicately rich, light-bodied but not lean, gently acidy. The peach-floral-lemon gesture deepens and leans toward chocolate. Only the finish is disappointing: short and slightly but distractingly astringent.",Price: NA, Jun 2006
89.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Bella Kara,"The aroma is intense and complex: cherry, blueberry, brandy, chocolate, with an underlying edge of pungently spicy cedar. All carry richly into the cup with an excitement a bit too edgy for elegance. A slight shadow of astringency lurking in the cup emerges clearly in the long finish.",, Jun 2006
90.0,Organic Fair-Trade Ethiopia Sidamo Shanta Golba,"Opulently complex aroma: cherry, blueberry, dry semi-sweet chocolate, brandy. In the cup very sweet, gently rich; the chocolate grows rounder and more distinct with continued blueberry and brandy complication. The rich, dry brandy notes dominate a slight astringency in the finish.",, Jun 2006
90.0,Guatemala Antigua,"Simple but classically appealing coffee. High-toned, sweetly spicy aroma with tight-knit suggestions of flowers, chocolate and sweet tomato that amplify in the richly acidy cup. The finish stays on the roundly hearty side of astringent.",, Jun 2006
93.0,Bolivia Carrasco Pica del Tucan,"The attraction of this coffee is a structure both powerful and elegant: richly and roundly acidy, with silky-verging-on-syrupy mouthfeel, fundamental sweetness, and ringing depth of sensation. The wispy hints of chocolate, cherry and cedar are a bonus. Reader Mike Venditto's nomination of a Counter Culture coffee was not available, so we substituted this rather similar Bolivia.",, Jun 2006
86.0,Marques de Paiva Gourmet Organic Decaf,"Sweet-toned, intense aroma with walnut and chocolate notes and a hint of peach-like fruit. In the cup gentle, delicate, sweet, with a pleasantly vegetal cocoa character, a continued hint of fruit, and walnut tones that turn just a bit flat and woody as the cup cools. Delicate, pleasing but simple finish with continued walnut notes.",, May 2006
87.0,Marques de Paiva Gourmet Organic Dark Roast,"Simple profile but deep, roasty and rich, quietly complicated by pungent cedar and suggestions of semisweet chocolate and yellow fruit, apricot perhaps. The mouthfeel is plump with a slight, not unpleasant roughness. The short finish is a touch astringent but quite rich; the chocolate tones linger nicely in the long.",, May 2006
88.0,Marques de Paiva Gourmet Organic Medium Roast,"Deep, pungently sweet aroma with cocoa, caramelly cedar, raisin, date and honey notes. In the cup rich, low-key, gently bittersweet with continued, very distinct cocoa and honey/date notes. Long finish with excellent flavor persistence. The cup flattens slightly as it cools.",, May 2006
88.0,Marques de Paiva Gourmet Rainforest Alliance Breakfast Blend,"A gently sweet, ingratiating coffee. In the aroma caramel, cedar and orange notes with a hint of flowers. In the cup very sweet, with a dominating fruit-toned cocoa that carries into the long, clean finish.",, May 2006
88.0,Marques de Paiva Gourmet Fair Trade French Roast,"The roast dominates the coffee, though gently. Toast, cedar and a hint of chocolate in the aroma.

89.0,Full Natural Espresso Blend,"Sweet-toned, round, caramelly aroma with hints of flowers and pears or peach. In the small cup full-bodied with a dominating sweet, cedary pungency complicated by raisiny fruit and dark chocolate with a slight whiff of brandyish ferment. In milk balanced and rich, with continued semi-sweet chocolate, richly grapy ferment and even a surprising resurfacing of flowers.",, May 2006
89.0,Wakeman Espresso,"Balanced but subdued aroma: smoke, flowers, a hint of peach-toned fruit.

Distinct and pleasing milk chocolate presence in milk.",, May 2006
90.0,Ruby’s Organic Espresso,"Simple but deep aroma with distinct berry notes - blueberry or blackberry - and a hint of milk chocolate.

In milk the berry notes round and soften toward a lush banana-toned chocolate.",, May 2006
90.0,Sweetness! Espresso (Fair Trade/Organic),"In the aroma distinct semi-sweet chocolate notes and cherryish or raisiny fruit with a lush twist of ferment. Crisp cedar and toast notes complicate the cherry-toned chocolate in the small cup. The fruity chocolate persists in the splendid short finish, though a shadow astringency barely implied in the cup eventually dominates in the long. In milk a slightly lean body is more than made up for by crisp toasted rice notes and a voluptuous, milk-softened version of the fruity-fermented chocolate.",, May 2006
90.0,Fieldheads Espresso,"Delicate, sweet-toned aroma: butter, flowers, the barest hints of chocolate and cedar. In the small cup medium-bodied, smooth in texture, gently and sweetly pungent in flavor with caramel and cedar notes. Simple but deep presence in milk, with pronounced semi-sweet chocolate tones and a clear hint of flowers.",, May 2006

91.0,Tawar Rouge,"Superb fruity, caramelly aroma with distinct brandy and chocolate notes. In the small cup medium body, dominated by caramel and cedar notes with only a hint of cherryish brandy intrigue. The fruity brandy tones intensify in the finish, though with a very slight bitterish edge. They reach their apotheosis in milk, however, where they finally free themselves from their slight bitter shadow and bloom with lush, powerful expressiveness.",, May 2006
92.0,S.O. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"Delicately soft aroma: dusk-blooming flowers, lemon, a hint of milk chocolate and caramel. In the small cup medium to light in body but smooth in mouthfeel, with continued lemon and floral top notes working above gently pungent cedar and semi-sweet chocolate mid-tones. Sweet, long, roundly lemony finish. In milk just on the edge of thin-bodied, but the lemony chocolate flavor notes are distinctive and superb.",, May 2006
92.0,Nicaragua Madriz Cup of Excellence Single Origin Espresso,"Delicate but deep aroma: flowers, orange, peach, with a suggestion of chocolate.

94.0,S.O. India Sitara,"Deep, very sweet-toned aroma, with chocolate, flowers, walnut, and a hint of carnal fruit - peach or papaya. In the small cup very full body, but not heavy - the mouthfeel is lively, almost effervescent. In flavor very sweet, very deep, with cedar and a gently spicy semi-sweet chocolate. Superb finish: long, caramelly, rich. Exerts a simple but powerful presence in milk: sweet milk chocolate with perhaps a shimmer of flowers.",, May 2006
94.0,Belle Espresso,"Intense aroma: brandy, chocolate, caramel.

84.0,100% Kona Medium Roast,"Pungent, spicy or perhaps smoky aroma, with caramel notes and a hint of apple. In the cup rather sharply acidy with very distinct caramel notes and not much else. A bright, simple, limited coffee.",, Apr 2006
85.0,Kona Fancy,"A contradictory coffee, with sweetly buoyant flowering grass and vanilla notes shimmering above a pungent heaviness in both aroma and cup. The pungent notes hint at semi-sweet chocolate in the aroma but turn rather bitter in the cup, compromising the continuing agreeable floral character.",, Apr 2006
85.0,Maui Mokka,"Fermented fruit contributes to a glorious aroma dominated by a sort of dry, nutty chocolate. In the cup very sweet and floral but also quite astringent, netting a wildly ambiguous profile with intriguing fruit notes too astringent to call chocolate and too explosively fermented to call winy. Unorthodox palates might assign high ratings to this unusual coffee, while purists surely would choke and dismiss it. We compromised at 85 - buyers beware.",, Apr 2006
85.0,100% Kona Peaberry Dark Roast,"Sweetly roasty throughout the profile: fresh-cut cedar and hints of cardamom and flowers in the aroma; in the cup silky in mouthfeel, very sweet, with continuing cedar and intensified floral notes. Slightly astringent, almost turpenny in the long finish.",, Apr 2006
87.0,Twigg-Smith Estate Ohana Medium Roast,"Fine aroma: delicate but deep, with milk chocolate, floral and caramelly fruit notes, apple perhaps. In the cup softly acidy, velvety in mouthfeel; the chocolate turns toward sweet cocoa with a richly tart floral twist. Surprisingly long finish, but also surprisingly heavy and even astringent. Cups were slightly uneven with occasional very faint musty fermented suggestions as they cooled, so a rating that started at 90 ended at an ambivalent 87.",, Apr 2006
87.0,Kona Fancy,"High-toned, delicate (almost too) aroma: flowers, caramel, pipe tobacco. A bit sharp and astringent in the cup, but with a richly rounding caramel character and fine floral top notes. The caramel settles toward chocolate in the finish.",, Apr 2006
87.0,Kona Mountain Estate,"Simple, rather subdued aroma: cherry and chocolate notes. In the cup rich, pungent and sweet, but aromatically simple: dried cherries, a hint of chocolate, perhaps suggestions of merlot-like red wine.",, Apr 2006
88.0,100% Kona Pau Hana Estate Organic,"Classic aroma: cleanly high-toned, slightly acidy, with flowers, peach, and a hint of milk chocolate. In the cup sweetly and brightly acidy, with continued floral, peach and black currant notes. The flavor drops off in a rather disappointing finish.",, Apr 2006
88.0,Kona Fancy,"Rich aroma: semi-sweet chocolate and suggestions of apple, with floral notes at the top. In the cup rather big-bodied and rich, with continuing distinct floral top notes and a rather dominating, roundly tart acidity that nearly overwhelms but still allows further suggestions of chocolate, ripe tomato, orange and cedar.",, Apr 2006
91.0,Hawaiian Blend,"A pungent, sweetly tart, tight-knit complexity - cedar, orange, semi-sweet chocolate - runs through the profile from aroma through the long, rich finish. Magisterial and consistent when hot; stiffens and simplifies just slightly as the cup cools.",, Apr 2006
92.0,Kona Peaberry Medium Roast,"Roundly delicate aroma: chocolate and caramel notes with suggestions of flowers and ripe tomato. In the cup silky mouthfeel and a classic profile: tart fruitiness enveloped in a giddy sweetness that harbors continued hints of chocolate and flowers. Clean, sweet - almost sugary - finish.",, Apr 2006
90.0,Heifer Hope Blend Light Roast (K‑Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): A complex and rather exotic profile. Round, low-acid fruit (apple?) in the aroma, leaning toward chocolate, with a hint of flowers. In the cup lively, wine-like acidity, with apple, floral, chocolate, nutmeg-like spice notes. Chocolate and apple resurface in the long, quietly rich finish.",, Mar 2006
85.0,Newman’s Own Organics Extra Bold (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Very mild, sweet, smokily cedar-toned aroma. In the cup simple, relatively rich for a K-cup brewed coffee, with dried fruit notes - raisins, cherries - that verge on a dark chocolate. Sweet, mildly astringent finish.",, Mar 2006
87.0,Newman’s Own Organics Special Decaf (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Mild but complex aroma: distinct caramel notes and hints of butter (perhaps butterscotch), vanilla and chocolate. Gentle, wine-toned acidity and sweet, delicate flavor with grapey red wine and floral notes and a hint of chocolate. Shallow but quietly persistent finish.",, Mar 2006
85.0,National Wildlife Blend (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): A coffee either pleasingly subtle and delicate or disappointingly subdued and shallow depending on taste and expectation. Caramel, flowers and a hint of smoke or perhaps cinnamon in the aroma. In the cup gently acidy, light-bodied but silky in mouthfeel and mild in flavor, with hints of caramel, cocoa, pear and sweet flowering grass. Very sweet but simple finish.",, Mar 2006
86.0,Papua New Guinea,"Most cups of this sample were very sweet in aroma and flavor, with soft earth tones (think the odor of freshly fallen, moist leaves that have just begun to compost), and pleasingly round cherry, cocoa and caramel notes. Unfortunately one cup of five was very, very foul tasting, probably owing to a bad bean called a ""stinker,"" so we deducted 4 points from a coffee that otherwise might merit a 90.",, Mar 2006
87.0,Papua New Guinea,"Softly sweet-toned, rather simple aroma - raisin and chocolate notes. In the cup a lean but rather silky mouthfeel, with continued raisin and sweet pipe tobacco notes and a continued lean toward milk chocolate. Simple, straightforward finish with a shimmer of astringency in the long.",, Mar 2006
88.0,Papua New Guinea,"Simple but deep aroma, with resonant raisiny chocolate tones. In the cup lean-bodied, delicate, fundamentally sweet and rather lush but dryly smoky with a hint of fruit that reads as white wine or grapefruit. Concludes simply but richly.",, Mar 2006
88.0,Organic Papua New Guinea,"Deep, sweet-toned, buttery aroma with a spicy, cedary chocolate and a hint of fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup delicately robust, with a roundly lush but continuing spicy, cedary, almost black-peppery chocolate and a suggestion of coconut, the sweet processed kind. Roundly rich finish.",, Mar 2006
88.0,New Guinea,"Very sweet, caramelly aroma with milk chocolate notes and hints of earth and cedar. In the cup richly acidy, with continued caramel and milk chocolate notes. Rather limited in nuance but not a lazy cup; a simple, straightforwardly pleasing gesture.",, Mar 2006
89.0,Private Reserve Papua New Guinea,"Sweetly smoky, cedary aroma with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup a particularly full body and creamy mouthfeel, sweetly and richly acidy, but with limited nuance - hints of cedar and tart cherry, perhaps a continuing suggestion of semi-sweet chocolate. Simple but sweetly rich finish.",, Mar 2006
90.0,Fair-Trade Organic New Guinea,"Softly low-toned fruit - bananas, semi-sweet chocolate - with a twist of cedar in the aroma. In the cup sweetly earthy with a fruit that displays a hint of ferment. Together this package reads as an earthy orange or raisin with a lean toward semi-sweet chocolate. Quietly rich, slightly rough finish with a pleasingly persistent earthy chocolate character.",, Mar 2006
90.0,Papua New Guinea Arokara,"Sweetly smoky, deep-toned aroma with fruit notes that suggest a sort of chocolaty papaya. In the cup deeply and fundamentally sweet, with spicy, smoky tones and a lush fruit that again suggested chocolate, but with a sweet grapefruit cast. Clean, rich, long finish.",, Mar 2006
91.0,Beemer’s Papua New Guinea,"Delicate aroma with softly pungent cedar and sweet tomato notes. In the cup gently and crisply acidy, with distinct floral notes and coffee fruit that reads as a tart, chocolate-toned cherry. A simple but very pure coffee expression.",, Mar 2006
91.0,Papua New Guinea Bunum Wo Peaberry,"Delicate but deep aroma, with chocolate, pipe tobacco and leather notes. In the cup earthy but richly sweet, almost sugary, with cherry fruit notes that acquire a chocolate depth in the profoundly sweet finish.",, Mar 2006
93.0,Papua New Guinea – Kimel Estate,"Sweet-toned, delicate aroma with butter notes and hints of chocolate and Mediterranean spice. Even sweeter in the cup, still delicate but rich, softly acidy and quietly complex with distinct floral notes and a crisp, subtle fruit that suggests Riesling table wine or perhaps black currant. The fruit notes turn toward cocoa in the long, continuing sweet finish.",, Mar 2006
90.0,Bolivia Calama Marka Cup of Excellence Prize Winner,"Heady, intense aroma: milk chocolate, leather, flowers, sweet lemon and tomato. In the cup a richly tart acidity dominates, rounded by sweetness but bold and uncompromising. Lemon and sweet tomato notes lean toward chocolate. As the cup cools the acidity softens toward a clean, sweet finish, bracing but astringency free.",, Mar 2006
88.0,Tim’s Blend,"In the aroma roasty, with fresh-cut cedar, semi-sweet chocolate and a low-acid, banana-like fruit. Sweet and continued roasty in the cup, with dry, low-toned notes that read as chocolate-leaning walnut and berry with an occasional hint of a musty malt. Rich in the short finish, astringent but nicely nuanced with chocolate in the long.",, Mar 2006
90.0,Tres Mujeres Blend,"Sweetly intense, balanced aroma, with milk chocolate, cedar and ripe tomato notes. In the cup the acidity is sweet and well-integrated, the body full and mouthfeel supple, and the flavor quite sweet, with chastened but still rich complication: semi-sweet chocolate, ripe tomato, and a round, low-acid fruit that suggested banana. The finish is cocoa-toned and slightly though warmly astringent.",, Feb 2006
90.0,Hair Raiser Blend,"Smoky, deep-toned aroma with a tightly-knit complexity: cedar, flowers, pineapple, vanilla, semi-sweet chocolate. Simplifies a bit in the cup, but remains richly and roundly bittersweet with an impressive smoky rather than burned character and a tickle of pineapply fruit. The sweet, expansive finish reveals a slight touch of astringency but the semi-sweet chocolate and fruit notes linger agreeably.",, Feb 2006
85.0,Colombia,"A classic but quiet, rather lazy cup. Caramelly, richly roasty aroma with ripe tomato, cedar and sweet orange complications. Similarly quiet in the cup, with a hint of chocolate joining the tomato, orange and cedar notes. Simple but rich finish.",, Feb 2006
87.0,Colombia Narino Supremo,"The roast dominates here, deeply pungent and cedary in the aroma, with floral and Mediterranean herb top notes. Roundly and sweetly roasty in the cup, lightish in body but deep in dimension, with floral top notes and a cedary, herb-toned chocolate. Clean, rich and chocolaty in the short finish, though a burned astringency surfaces in the long, particularly as the cup cools.",, Feb 2006
88.0,Colombian,"In the aroma sweetly deep-toned, slightly smoky, with suggestions of cinnamon, caramel and a round banana-like fruit. In the cup quite caramelly and sweet, gently roasty, with a slight mildewy ferment that gives the cup an earthy, cocoa-toned character. Rich, complexly cocoa-toned finish.",, Feb 2006
90.0,Colombian Organic Full City Roast,"Sweet-toned, deeply roasty aroma, with cedar, chocolate, sweet orange and floral complication. Simplifies a bit in the cup, but displays a simple, powerful richness with muted, tight-knit complexity: chocolate, cedar, pruny dry plum. Cleanly rich in the finish.",, Feb 2006
90.0,Cool Breeze Colombian,"Delicately complex, high-toned aromatics are the glory here. Giddily fruity aroma, with distinct vanilla notes and suggestions of white wine, custardy caramel, flowers, chocolate. In the cup delicate and very sweet, with continuing floral, wine (Riesling) and semi-sweet chocolate notes. The floral delicacy carries into the slightly astringent finish. Too delicate for this world: loses some of its refreshing complexity as the cup cools.",, Feb 2006
90.0,Colombian Huila Valencia,"A classic, cherryish sweet ferment runs lushly from aroma through finish. In the aroma the sweet ferment reads as an expansive cherry-toned milk chocolate; in the cup it takes on a Cabernet character, though still chocolaty. The short finish is superb: rich, deep, sweet, chocolaty. Slight astringency in the long finish. The ferment tones remain sound and sweet as the cup cools.",, Feb 2006
91.0,Colombia La Balvanera,"Flowers dominate in the lush, buttery, apple- and cherry-toned aroma. Gently and sweetly acidy in the cup, light-bodied, delicately rich, with more giddy floral notes, a sweet, orangy citrus, and an underlying roundly chocolaty fruit. Richly delicate finish.",Price: NA, Feb 2006
91.0,Colombia Inza Cauca,"A soft, opulently ingratiating coffee. Sweet-toned aroma with distinct banana/peach notes and a hint of milk chocolate. In the cup medium-bodied but silky in mouthfeel, with a lush, sweet acidity, floral top notes and chocolate, peach and ripe tomato tones influenced by a slight smokiness.",, Feb 2006
91.0,Colombian Organic Medium Roast,"Musty earth tones of the kind typical of Sumatras rather than Colombias complicate an otherwise sweet, richly acidy cup. The musty tones read as a cedary spice, perhaps black pepper, and are enveloped in a deep chocolate richness with some slight, vanilla-toned top notes. Sweet finish with a gentle balancing astringency.",, Feb 2006
92.0,Colombia Tres Santos Micro-Lot Melange,"Very deep, resonant aroma, with distinct floral and cherry-toned coffee fruit notes, buttery chocolate, and a slight, bracing suggestion of fresh-cut cedar. In the cup giddily and sweetly acidy, with continued clear, intense floral notes and a Chardonnay-like fruit. A hint of butter and, as the cup cools, ripe tomato. The cleanly rich finish stiffens just slightly as the cup cools.",, Feb 2006
92.0,Colombian Los Idolos,"A contradictory but balanced profile: The sweetly winy acidity is rounded by a cedar-toned roastiness, with raisin, apple, semi-sweet chocolate and caramel complications. Raisin is particularly prominent in the deep, gently roasty aroma, chocolate in the finish.",, Feb 2006
92.0,Colombia Supremo,"Very sweet-toned, intense aroma with distinctly buttery vanilla notes and hints of chocolate, honey and flowers. In the cup sweetly and richly acidy. The fundamental flavor complex is a chocolaty coffee fruit with heady complications of vanilla, flowers and honey.",, Feb 2006
93.0,Colombia Inza Cauca,"In the aroma distinct semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and floral notes, with a hint of ripe tomato. Quiet but lush in the cup, with floral notes enveloped in a voluptuous milk- chocolate- and caramel-toned fruit that persists in the gently rich finish.",, Feb 2006
93.0,Colombia La Esperanza,"High-toned, delicate aroma, with sweet flowering grass and cherryish coffee fruit notes, hints of flowers, milk chocolate, apple-toned pipe tobacco. In the cup rich but still delicate with flower and apple notes and a wine-like, or perhaps apple cider-like, character, crisp yet lush. Clean, sweetly tart finish.",, Feb 2006
94.0,Colombia Pitalito Estate,"A classically lyric coffee. The aroma is intense and enveloping, with spicy ripe tomato, bittersweet chocolate, caramel, and banana-like fruit notes. The ripe tomato and dark chocolate notes carry into a cup shimmering with sweet, wine-toned acidity and the unusual banana-like fruit notes, which even seem reflected in the pleasant viscosity of the mouthfeel.",, Feb 2006
87.0,Sumatra Mandheling Supergrade,"Delicate but intense aroma: sandalwood, hints of cherryish fruit. In the cup lean in mouthfeel; the aromatic wood notes settle toward chocolate while the fruit displays a distinct and pleasant grapefruit twist. The chocolate and fruit persist only momentarily in the finish before they are lost in astringency. Reader Frank Baker nominated this coffee as ""a quintessential Sumatra, absolutely the best I have ever tasted.""",, Jan 2006
88.0,Ethiopian Hama Gold Yirgacheffe Natural,"Intense aroma, very sweet in impression, with round blueberry, fresh leather and cedar notes. In the cup the roast turns the blueberry toward a rich chocolate, but also seems to develop an astringent edge to the cup. In the finish the lovely blueberry chocolate barely makes itself heard above the persistent astringency.",, Jan 2006
88.0,Organic Toraja,"A coffee whose uncompromisingly earthy character requires the same reorientation of conventional taste as do peaty malt whiskies. Distinct moist fallen leaf notes in the aroma with hints of sweet fruit ferment that with some imagination read as chocolate. In the cup the fallen leaf tones turn distinctly humus-like with continued hints of a sort of fermented chocolate. Medium body, syrupy mouthfeel. The chocolate notes persist in the finish, softening and complicating a hardish astringency.",, Jan 2006
89.0,Daterra Brazil Sweet Yellow Bourbon,"I found myself using the term ""delicate"" several times in describing this coffee: delicate coffee fruit tones in the aroma, delicate but smooth mouthfeel, and a delicately complex flavor: nuts, dried fruit (raisins perhaps) with hints of wine and semi-sweet chocolate. Roaster Bob Baker nominated this coffee, citing its ""sweet, honey laden cup.""",, Jan 2006
89.0,Black Apron Kirinyaga Kenya,"Delicately fruity aroma, sweet cherry with a hint of chocolate. In the cup sweet, rich, surprisingly full-bodied, with a dry, wine-toned black currant fruit and a slight burned undercurrent. Sweetly rich short finish, but a hint of burned astringency shadows the long. This was the highest rated of three Starbucks coffees nominated and reviewed for this article.",, Jan 2006
89.0,Roastmaster Blend,"Impressively round, deep aroma with semi-sweet chocolate and hints of blueberry and fresh-cup cedar. Quiets in the cup, but the pleasing complex of semi-sweet chocolate, cedar and blueberry persists. Blueberry dominates the in the richly sweet though slightly astringent finish.",, Jan 2006
89.0,Papua New Guinea Kinjibi Medium Roast,"Richly mid-toned aroma with sweet earth notes complicated by hints of caramel, chocolate and Mediterranean herbs. In the cup a lush sweetness envelopes intensified chocolate and caramel notes and continuing sweet earth and pungent herb tones, with a hint of grapefruity citrus. This complexity fades rather quickly in an otherwise pleasant finish. Nominating reader Al Welker cites this coffee as ""very special giving a mellow low acid cup when roasted medium.""",, Jan 2006
89.0,Smooth Groove (Fair Trade Organic Blend),"A wonderfully deeply dimensioned coffee. Low-toned, resonant aroma complicated by vanilla, caramel and chocolate notes. In the cup roundly bittersweet, big-bodied, simple but lush. With patience vanilla and dark chocolate notes re-emerge. The finish is sweet and rich, though marred by a mild but distinct astringency. Reader Steve Prenzlauer nominated The Groovy Mind roasting company generally for its coffee quality and devotion to organic and Fair-Trade principles.",, Jan 2006
90.0,Sumatra Dark,"In the aroma the earthy scent of moist fallen leaves and sweet grapefruit, with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup I couldn't find the chocolate, but the fresh-turned, leafy earth tones and the sweet grapefruit intensified. The earth tones remain soft and free of hardness in the long, sweet finish. This is one of several Van Houtte coffees cited by reader Carolyn Jones, who simply testifies that Van Houtte has ""awesome coffee!""",, Jan 2006
91.0,Costa Rica Tres Rios,"A big, deep, simple gesture of a coffee. Roundly resonant aroma with fresh-cut cedar and semi-sweet chocolate notes. Reveals a slight bitter edge in the cup, but remains fundamentally deep, rich and full-bodied, complicated by continuing cedar and raisin-toned dark chocolate notes.",, Jan 2006
93.0,Colombia Tres Santos Micro-Lot Almaguer,"Pure yet extravagant notes of coffee fruit and flowers themselves carry with breathtaking simplicity from aroma into the sweetly acidy cup. I don't recall having experienced the taste of the coffee fruit (think sweetly tart cherries) and the voluptuous scent of the coffee flower (jasmine) so distinctly and so intensely. The slightly astringent finish and turn toward ripe tomato as the cup cools reveals that, at this writing, the coffee is perhaps a bit young, but drink it now because tomorrow it will be out the roaster door. Nominated by reader Herman Reichold who calls it ""one of - if not the - best coffees I have had the pleasure to drink.""",, Jan 2006
95.0,"Hamma Cooperative Yirgacheffe, Fair-Trade Organic","The scent of blueberry fills the room simply in the act of grinding this explosively fragrant coffee. Blueberry continues richly to dominate the wet aroma, nuanced by hints of other low-acid fruit - peach perhaps, and chocolate. In the cup the fruit inclines more toward wine and a lush, minty chocolate, but the blueberry reasserts itself in the finish. Only in the long finish is there a hint of the serendipitous ferment responsible for much of this aromatic excitement. Probably as close to a perfect example of this coffee type as this imperfect world allows, tactfully roasted.",, Jan 2006
73.0,Cafe Kind of Day 100% Colombian,"(Tasted as produced by the Melitta One:One single-serve brewing device using a Melitta 44mm pod at a cup volume of 8 ounces): Soft, shallow aroma with vanilla- and peach-toned fruit notes. In the cup this coffee landed on the palate like a liquid brick: bitter, hard and monotoned. Some sweetness and vague suggestions of vanilla and caramel were quite overwhelmed by bitterness in the cup and a soapy astringency in the finish.",, Dec 2005
75.0,Colombian Dark Roast,"(As brewed in a Juan Valdez Pod Coffee Maker in a Juan Valdez 55mm pod at a cup volume of 5 ounces): Shallow, sweet, smoky aroma, with some peach-toned fruit and a hint of cardboard. In the cup simple and bittersweet with a possibility of reading the bitter side as walnut. The cardboard tones hinted in the aroma turn disturbingly old-board woody.",, Dec 2005
79.0,Arabica Express Organic Colombian,"(As brewed in a Krups 1010 single-serve brewing device in a Podhead Sensation 62mm pod at a cup volume of 6 ounces):  Simple, sweet, subdued, vaguely fruity aroma, with a slight hint of smoke. Bitterish, simple and shallow in the cup, with the only complication the same remote hints of fruit and smoke.",, Dec 2005
81.0,Arabica Express Guatemala Antigua,"(As brewed in a Black & Decker single-serve brewing device in a Podhead Sensation 62mm pod at a cup volume of 7 ounces):  Good complexity in the aroma -- caramel, sweet floral grass, hints of fresh leather and semi-sweet chocolate ? although the general impression remains shallow and thin. In the cup watery, half-heartedly bittersweet, with vague hints of fruit and chocolate. Simple but surprisingly rich finish.",, Dec 2005
81.0,Colombia,"(As brewed in a Flavia Fusion Drink Station using a Flavia proprietary single-serve pouch at a cup volume of 7 ounces): Subdued, delicate, vanilla-toned aroma. In the cup excellent body and mouthfeel, good sweetness, but very flat and monotoned in flavor, with a hint of fruit and cardboardy stale notes. No flavor whatsoever persists in the simple, slightly astringent finish.",, Dec 2005
81.0,Sumatran Reserve (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 7.25 ounces): Sweet, simple, caramelly aroma. In the cup medium-bodied but lean in mouthfeel, with a thinly pungent, musty/malty character and hints of cherryish fruit. A mild musty astringency in the finish leans toward rich.",, Dec 2005
82.0,Dark Roast,"(As brewed in a Senseo HD7810 single-serve brewing device in a Senseo brand 62mm pod at a cup volume of 8 ounces): Ingratiatingly sweet and caramelly aroma with remote suggestions of low-acid fruit: banana perhaps. In the cup thin bodied and lean. The sweet, mildly fermented fruit reads as a sort of dilute, wine-toned chocolate. The sweet chocolate persists rather richly in the short finish, but seems to grow a bit cloying in the long. (Same coffee, same pod as brewed in a Black & Decker One-Cup Coffee Maker at a cup volume of 7 ounces): The musty-fermented notes that read as caramelly and chocolaty in the Senseo cup come across here as, well, musty and fermented, although they charitably can be read as a sort of twisted semi-sweet chocolate, think chocolate crossed with fresh tobacco. Rated 78 as brewed in the Black & Decker.",, Dec 2005
83.0,Arabica Express Kenya AA,"(As brewed in a Juan Valdez Pod Coffee Maker in a Podhead Sensation 62mm pod at a cup volume of 5 ounces):  Flowers edging on sweet grass in the delicate, rather shallow aroma. In the cup softly and gently acidy, with tart but sweet cherry notes and a light (rather than thin) body and smooth mouthfeel. Short, clean, simple finish.",, Dec 2005
83.0,French Roast,"(As brewed in a Flavia Fusion Drink Station using a Flavia proprietary single-serve pouch at a cup volume of 7 ounces): Simple, smoky aroma with hints of flowers and fruit. In the cup shallow and sharply smoky, with muted complications of walnut and chocolate. The finish is heavy and rather astringent but rich, with continued hints of walnut and chocolate.",, Dec 2005
83.0,Colombia (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 7.25 ounces): Distinct vanilla and caramel aroma with a hint of sweetly acidy fruit, orange perhaps. In the cup light in body and delicate in mouthfeel, soft and simple in flavor with dilute hints of caramel and orange. Moderately rich in the short finish, very slightly astringent in the long.",, Dec 2005
84.0,Arabica Express Kenya AA,"(As brewed in a Melitta One:One single-serve brewing device in a Podhead Arabica Express brand 44mm pod at a cup volume of 5 ounces):  Subdued, faintly rich aroma, with wine and walnut notes and regrettable hints of cardboard. In the cup medium bodied with a roundly acidy, wine-like character and a touch of lush sweetness, though the cardboard still lurks. Rich in the short finish, mildly astringent in the long.",, Dec 2005
84.0,Ethiopian Kimssa (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Sweet, round aroma complicated by cherry-toned fruit notes. Rather rich in the cup, with decent body and sweet, wine-toned acidity but little else in the way of nuance. Clean, round short finish, slight bitterness in the long.",, Dec 2005
84.0,Toscana Light Roast,"(As brewed in a Bunn My Cafe single-serve brewing device using a 62mm pod at a cup volume of 5 ounces): Lovely aroma: balanced, delicately sweet, floral, with orange-toned citrus notes. Radically simplifies in the cup: turns ordinary, sweetly shallow, gently acidy, lean-bodied. The orange notes resurface in the thin but cleanly refreshing finish. (Same pod as brewed in the Krups 1010 at a cup volume of 6 ounces: Watery, shallow, delicately sweet acidity, remote suggestions of caramel and fruit, basically underextracted. Rating 79.)",, Dec 2005
84.0,Carte Noire,"(Tasted as produced by a Braun Tassimo Single Serve Coffee Maker brewing a Tassimo T-Disc at a cup volume determined by the coding on the capsule, in this case 3.5 ounces): Simple, sweetly smoky aroma, with some depth of sensation and floral and fruit hints. As would be expected given the short serving size, full-bodied in the cup, with a fermented musty fruit that reads as walnut and bitterish semi-sweet chocolate. Cardboardy undertones, perhaps owing to staling. Simple but surprisingly clean short finish, with some mild astringency in the long.",, Dec 2005
85.0,Arabica Express Sensation Brasil Santos,"(As brewed in a Senseo single-serve brewing device in a Podhead Sensation 62mm pod at a cup volume of 5 ounces):  Sweet, round, fairly deep aroma with hunts of chocolate and cherry. In the cup the chocolate and tart cherry notes grow more distinct, complicating a rather rich, sweetly balanced cup and carrying into the clean, round finish.",, Dec 2005
86.0,Folgers 100% Colombian,"(As tasted in a Krups 1010 single-serve brewing device using a 62mm diameter ""Home Cafe"" pod at a cup volume of 7.5 ounces): Sweetly acidy, winey, high-toned aroma, with some rounding caramel and vanilla notes. In the cup surprisingly full-bodied, sweetly balanced, complicated by wine (more rose than cabernet), vanilla, floral notes. Cleanly sweet, cherry-toned finish. (In the Black & Decker One Cup Coffee Maker and Mr. Coffee AT13, lower-priced single-serve machines taking similar-sized pods, the same Folgers 100% Colombia pod attracted a rating of 81. In the Bunn My Cafe, a machine designed to take multiple sizes of pod, the same pod scored 82.)",, Dec 2005
86.0,Douwe Egberts,"(As brewed in a Bunn My Cafe MCP single-serve brewing device using a 62mm pod at a cup volume of 5 ounces): Distinct sweet cocoa notes in the aroma, along with hints of low-acid fruit, cherry perhaps. In the cup richly acidy, lean-bodied but rich, with continued sweet cocoa and tart cherry notes with a shimmer of vanilla. Rich, tart but not overly astringent finish. The same pod brewed in the Krups 1010 at a cup volume of 6 ounces scored an 85 with a basically similar profile and description.",, Dec 2005
86.0,Breakfast Blend (K-Cup),"(As brewed in a Keurig B60 single-serve brewing device using a ""K-Cup"" capsule at a cup volume of 5.25 ounces): Subdued aroma, with dry fruit (cherry?) and fresh leather notes. In the cup shallow in sensation but crisply balanced, with suggestions of Meyer lemon, white wine, tart cherry edging toward chocolate. Thin but pleasantly sweet, cherry-toned finish.",, Dec 2005
93.0,Owner’s Reserve Kenya,"Sweet-toned aroma with a tightly knit, fruit-toned complexity: chocolate, dry berry, banana perhaps. Very sweet in the cup, almost sugary in impression, complicated by a classic African tart berry character: black currant or cassis, with hints of sweet lemon and chocolate. Tartly sweet, clean finish.",, Dec 2005
93.0,Kenya Tegu Nyeri,"Elegantly high-toned aroma: lemon, peach, berry, a delicate hint of walnut. In the cup medium in body but silky in mouthfeel, with crisply sweet, delicately acidy dry berry and Meyer lemon notes. The finish hovers on the edge of astringency but stays on the rich, bracing side of the sensation.",, Dec 2005
94.0,Sumatra Golden Mandheling,"An extraordinary coffee in the earth and fruit style of traditional Indonesias. In the aroma moist leaves turning toward fresh earth, together with buttery, candyish top notes. In the cup full-bodied, with pungent, moist earth tones and crisp, low-acid fruit notes suggesting pear and cherry. The pungent tones smooth out in a sweetly rich finish.",, Dec 2005
87.0,Heifer Hope Blend,"Dominated by a sweetly fermented fruit that reads as a rich, brandy-toned, cherryish chocolate. This lush flavor complex is heady in the aroma and sweetly refreshing in the cup. As the coffee cools, however, the ferment reveals a very slight bitter edge.",, Nov 2005
87.0,"Mayan Harvest Breakfast Blend, Organic Fair Trade","A rich and vividly fermented fruit dominates. The cherry-toned ferment is overlaid by a cedary roastiness in the aroma. In the cup the ferment deepens toward a dark chocolate and brandied cherry, but also displays a distracting pine or rosemary pungency. Smoothes out toward a cleanly rich chocolate in the short finish, though slightly astringent in the long.",, Nov 2005
88.0,Owner’s Reserve Guatemala,"A subtle, quietly complex profile. Delicate aroma, complicated by suggestions of spicy cherry and dry chocolate. In the cup sweetly and softly acidy, buoyant, with a tart chocolate complication; think pie cherries and milk chocolate. The chocolate persists in the simple but rich finish.",, Nov 2005
88.0,Organic Mexican Select Fair-Trade Medium Roast,"Intense aroma with a tightly knit complexity: muted spice, apple, pear, chocolate. In the cup sweet, delicate and balanced, with subtle but distinct chocolate notes and a quietly vibrant acidity. The chocolate turns toward cocoa in the mildly astringent finish.",, Nov 2005
89.0,Mexican Altura (Chiapas),"Mild, pleasingly sweet fermented fruit notes complicate aroma and cup and read as chocolate, red wine, cedary cherries, perhaps with a hint of sweet herb. The acidity is low-toned and balanced, the mouthfeel roundly smooth. The finish is clean but slightly thin.",, Nov 2005
89.0,El Injerto Guatemala SHB Huehuetenango,"This light-to-medium-roasted coffee is gently acidy with a floral and high-toned fruit character that quite simply represents the fresh, delicate taste of the coffee flower and fruit itself, carried with a roastmaster's tact from coffee to cup. The downside of this respectful roast is a slight, residual vegetal or tea-like character that some palates will find elegant and refreshing and others, well, too tea-like.",, Nov 2005
90.0,"Songbird Shadegrown Guatemalan, Organic Fair-Trade","Rich aroma complicated by smoky semi-sweet chocolate and caramel. The cup is simple but satisfying: very sweet, deep, roundly roasty. The real glory of this coffee is an extraordinarily long, lushly vibrant, deeply chocolaty finish.",, Nov 2005
90.0,Guatemala El Cuervo,"Intense, very deep aroma, with buttery or perhaps toffee-like notes and hints of flowers and wine. In the cup very sweet and very acidy, though never sharp. Continued hints of flowers and white wine. Rich, complex, slightly astringent in the finish.",, Nov 2005
90.0,Guatemala Finca Dos Marias,"A cabernet sort of coffee: boldly and richly dry, with fruit that reads as a wine-toned dry cherry or black currant with a rounding halo of chocolate. Tartly rich, long finish.",, Nov 2005
91.0,Guatemala Huehuetenango El Injerto,"Deep, complex aroma: slightly smoky cedar, chocolate and vanilla with floral top notes. Settles out to a rich semi-sweet chocolate in the cup with shimmery hints of flowers and vanilla. Rounds and sweetens as it cools without losing complexity. Very rich in the short finish, slightly astringent in the long.",, Nov 2005
92.0,Guatemala Huehuetenango,"Sweet-impressioned, deep aroma complicated by dried cherry and hints of chocolate and cedar. Simplifies slightly in the cup, but a silky sweetness and quiet, vibrant acidity compensate. Almost sugary sweet in the long, clean finish.",, Nov 2005
94.0,Guatemala Antigua – Finca La Tacita,"A voluptuously sweet coffee, with roundly integrated acidity, great balance and elegance, and a resonant, cherry-toned fruit that carries through the profile from the intense aroma to the rich, finely clean finish. Complicating notes of fresh cedar, flowers and black currant in both aroma and cup. The fruit turns slightly chocolate toward the finish.",, Nov 2005
88.0,Hula Daddy 100% Kona Peaberry,"A simple, rich, deeply dimensioned dark-roasted cup. Sweetly roasty in the aroma with semi-sweet chocolate notes. In the cup the roast continued to dominate with mildly charred wood tones overlaying semi-sweet chocolate and perhaps some dry berry notes. Rich, clean finish with continued dry chocolate notes.",, Oct 2005
91.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Natural Idido Misty Valley,"An exotic, almost violent cup. The aroma is lush with intense, shifting ripe to overripe fruit and floral notes, blueberry most distinctly, with pungent, sweet spice undertones. In the cup the fruit notes turn markedly winy, or perhaps cidery. A fermented version of blueberry remains dominant, but the rich, complexly suggestive fruit notes hint at chocolate as well. A slight, pungent saltiness shadows the cup, but smoothes out reassuringly in a convincingly smooth, long finish.",, Oct 2005
88.0,"Smuggler’s Brew, Medium-Dark Roast",Very impressive aroma: deep and lush with low-toned fruit (banana?) notes and hints of cedar and chocolate. In the cup crisp and roasty but still sweet with floral notes and a rich fruit that reads as semi-sweet chocolate. Simple but cleanly sweet finish.,, Oct 2005
87.0,Colombia La Carol,"Intense aroma: cedar, caramel, and a hint of fruit that reads as semi-sweet chocolate. Round and full in the cup, with the pungent, cedar-toned chocolate complicated by a shimmer of orange citrus. The pleasingly pungent cedar tones turn a bit heavy and astringent in the finish.",, Oct 2005
88.0,Honduras El Puente,"Smoky, cedar- and cherry-toned fruit in the aroma. In the cup round, rich, bittersweet, with a tart, cherryish chocolate - think pie cherries rolled in unsweetened chocolate - and a sweet, floral-toned acidity. The finish strikes me as slightly too astringent.",, Oct 2005
88.0,Honduras El Puente,"Gently bittersweet aroma with chocolate, cherry and cedar notes. Roundly rich in the cup, with distinct dry cocoa and surprising floral notes. Sweet and rich in the short finish, with a slight astringent bite in the long. Gains in power and quiet complexity as it cools.",, Oct 2005
89.0,Nicaragua Las Termopilas,"A quiet, very sweet, delicately chocolate-toned coffee. Caramel and chocolate tones dominate in aroma and cup, gently complicated by floral top notes. Slightly astringent in the long finish.",, Oct 2005
89.0,Bolivia Eusebio Marca,"A quiet but deeply rich coffee. Fresh-cut cedar and semi-sweet chocolate carry from the husky aroma through pungently sweet cup to an impressively long, resonant finish.",, Oct 2005
90.0,Guatemala Finca Calahute Alto,"Slight cedary roastiness in the aroma, with a peach- or banana-toned dark chocolate that carries into the cup with a rich, pungent sweetness. The low-toned fruit lingers pleasingly in the long finish.",, Oct 2005
90.0,Nicaragua Las Termopilas,"Extraordinary aroma: high-toned, delicate but intense, lilac and a chocolaty lemon. The chocolate-lemon and floral notes carry into the cup, but are backgrounded by a sweet but intense acidity. Clean, sweet finish.",, Oct 2005
91.0,Honduras Finca El Mirador,"A crisp, malty fruit runs through the profile, suggesting a low key bouquet of possibilities: peach, cedar, chocolate, black currant, cherry. The finish is particularly impressive, rich, sweet, long, and nuanced with persistent berry and cherry tones.",Price: NA, Oct 2005
91.0,Panama Esmeralda Special,"High-toned, complex aroma: lemon, flowers, sweet herbs, perhaps a cedar-toned, semi-sweet chocolate. Smoothes and quiets in the cup, with the semi-sweet chocolate, lemon and herb notes dominating. Slight but pleasing astringency in the finish.",, Oct 2005
91.0,Honduras El Mirador,"Deep aroma with dry floral and tart berry and chocolate notes. Sweetly high-toned and acidy in the cup, delicately rich, hints of dry berry, sweet herb, flowers. Lightly astringent but refreshing finish.",, Oct 2005
92.0,Panama Esmeralda Especial,"Exquisitely delicate aroma suggests a fine Oolong tea, with extravagant floral notes but a distinct (and coffeeish) hint of chocolate. The chocolate strengthens in the cup, with a tartly sweet, lemon-toned acidity. The lemon-chocolate notes outlast a gentle astringency in the long, pleasing finish.",Price: NA, Oct 2005
88.0,Fair Trade Organic Peru,"Lushly complex but delicate aroma, alive with floral and low-acid fruit notes: apple perhaps, even banana, leaning toward chocolate. In the cup displays a simplifying sharpness when hot, but softens and sweetens as the cup cools. The seductively low-acid fruit notes persist from aroma into cup, reading as red wine and chocolate. The finish is long and rich with a slight astringent edge.",, Sep 2005
90.0,Ecco Reserve Espresso,"A refined, quietly understated espresso. Delicately complex aroma with vanilla and milk chocolate innuendos. Medium body, smooth mouthfeel in the small cup, balanced in flavor with a slight cedary sharpness and semi-sweet chocolate notes. Maintains its dry chocolate, muted fruit elegance nicely in milk. Co-taster Ted Lingle's rating: 91; Ken's: 89. Nominating reader Teri Bolla remarks accurately on this blend's balance, ""total finesse"" and ""fruit/cocoa floral"" character.",, Sep 2005
80.0,Espresso,"For both Ken (81) and co-taster Ted Lingle (79) the aroma was muted and burned. Ted found the body in the small cup light; Ken (81) found it fuller but rough in mouthfeel. Nor did Ken or Ted have much positive to say about flavor: pungent and rough for Ted, burned and sharp for Ken. In milk pleasantly sweet but thin-bodied for Ted; Ken was more positive here, finding that the milk smoothed out the sharply roasty character of the coffee, turning it toward a pleasing fresh leather and a clove-toned spice. The reader who nominated this blend found it ""exceptional, that's all.""",Price: NA, Sep 2005
82.0,Espresso Paladino,"Once past the aroma, co-taster Ted Lingle (79) had little positive to say about this blend, finding it lean in body, rather burned/bitter in flavor, and weak in presence in milk. Ken (84) also found the mouthfeel too lean and the finish too astringent, but enjoyed the berry-like, chocolate-leaning fruit that carried through the profile from aroma to milk. The reader who nominated this blend said he wanted ""to see if this espresso is everything it is claimed it is.""",, Sep 2005
86.0,"Organic Espresso, N. Italian Style","Ken and co-taster Ted Lingle ended with comparable overall ratings (Ken 85, Ted 86) but differed in how they got there. Ted found the aroma a bit flat; Ken found it delicate, with toast, apple and floral notes. Ted found the body fuller and the mouthfeel more substantial than Ken did. Both found the flavor in the small cup toasty/smoky and a bit sharp in the finish. Both admired the way the blend rounded and sweetened in milk. Nominating reader Robert Bobbs praised this blend as ""perfectly balanced ... big body, slightly sweet, not too much acidity but enough to enliven the cup; holds up well in big milky drinks but is fantastic as a straight shot.""",, Sep 2005
87.0,Ambrosia Espresso,"An attractive if underpowered espresso. Muted notes of flowers, fruit and chocolate in the aroma. In the small cup medium-bodied, supple in mouthfeel, but limited in flavor: some floral hints persist but the main impression is a thinnish pungency that Ken (87) called smoky and co-taster Ted Lingle (86) spicy. Nevertheless, rounds and richens in the finish, and reveals a round, semi-sweet chocolate character in milk. Nominating reader Andrey Akselrod says simply ""It is one of my favorite espressos.""",, Sep 2005
88.0,Custom Espresso,"Delicate floral and vanilla-toned aroma, clean and precious. In the small cup medium-bodied, with a sweet, softly fruity character that suggests banana, perhaps, or papaya. Long, sweetly resonant finish with a slight astringent bite. Co-taster Ted Lingle (88) felt this soft, delicate blend faded a bit in milk; Ken (88) found it limited perhaps in nuance but sweet and substantial in presence. Nominating reader Martin Freeman exclaims that this ""best espresso blend ever ... rich, creamy ... deep, fragrant ..."" is ""WORLD CLASS.""",, Sep 2005
89.0,Indian-Indonesian Espresso,"Ken (90) liked this espresso with its earthy-musty influenced aromatics considerably more than co-taster Ted Lingle (87). In the aroma, vanilla, floral, earth, leather and fruit notes. In the small cup medium body, leanish but smooth mouthfeel, with a rather sharp, musty/fruity flavor that persisted in the mildly astringent but resonant finish. Probably at its best in milk, which rounded and softened the coffee, turning the musty fruit toward a pleasingly complex chocolate. Reader Adam Harvey testifies that ""Simply put, [this] is the best espresso I have ever tasted. And I have tasted plenty.""",, Sep 2005
90.0,Finesso Espresso,"A full-bodied espresso with exotic aromatics. Floral and fruit tones throughout the profile, with pungent notes that read as herbal for co-taster Ted Lingle (90) and licorice-like and smoky for Ken (89). For Ken the full body and heavy mouthfeel seemed partly to stifle flavor in the small cup, but for both Ken and Ted this blend came into its own in milk, where it rounded and sweetened richly without losing power or nuance. Nominated by Kemp LaMunyon of Las Vegas.",, Sep 2005
91.0,Hayes Valley Espresso,"A smoky, cedary espresso with a deep-toned fruit that in the small cup suggests semi-sweet chocolate or perhaps a rich port wine. Ken (90) and co-taster Ted Lingle (93) differed a bit on this blend's impact in milk: Ted found this blend mastered milk with an impressive sweetness and richness; for Ken the chocolate carried nicely into milk but the mouthfeel was a bit lean. Nominating reader Christopher Losa testified to his admiration for this blend in almost lurid terms: ""rich, thick, and chocolaty...the way it syrups out of the portafilter is absolutely sexy...comparative to a California Zin or a Petit Syrah fruit bomb wine.'",, Sep 2005
91.0,Espresso Temescal,"Exceptionally complex espresso that maintains aromatic intrigue from aroma through a rather majestic finish in milk. Elegant aroma with deep-toned fruit and herb notes. In the small cup smooth in mouthfeel and medium-full in body, slightly sharp and acidy in structure but with a continued fruity complexity that reads persuasively as chocolate. Both co-cupper Ted Lingle (92) and Ken (90) were particularly impressed by this blend's performance in milk: lavishly fruity and chocolaty with a rich, clean finish. Blue Bottle's espressos were nominated by reader Christopher Losa.",, Sep 2005
92.0,Peggy Sue’s Espresso,"A crisply classic espresso. Fresh leather and spice notes in the aroma. In the small cup the mouthfeel is a bit lean but the flavor complex: dry berry, wine, semi-sweet chocolate, cedar. The wine and berry notes persist in the long, clean finish. In milk perhaps a bit lean in mouthfeel, but the cedar and berry notes bloom sweetly. Ken's rating: 90. Co-taster Ted Lingle's: 93. Turns out this espresso was nominated by the roaster, Peggy Sue herself, but roasters are readers too.",, Sep 2005
92.0,Espresso Bella Luna,"An impressively sweet, smooth, deeply dimensioned, softly complex espresso. Co-cupper Ted Lingle (92) used the term ""resonant"" twice to describe flavor and finish in the small cup. Ken (90) was most impressed by the details: a fresh-cut cedar character that was pungent but sweet and round, and wine-toned fruit notes. Bloomed in milk with discreet balance and a rich chocolate. Reader Chris Horn nominated another of Supreme Bean's espresso blends, but we ended up reviewing this one instead (don't ask).",, Sep 2005
93.0,Daterra Reserve,"Both Ken and co-taster Ted Lingle remarked on the ""lush but elegant"" (Ken) aroma and fat, buttery body of this single-origin espresso. In the small cup, dry berry notes and semi-sweet chocolate. Blooms sweetly and richly in milk. Ken found the flavor in cup and milk a bit too simple, limiting his score to a 90, but for Ted the profile throughout was complete, classic, and worth a resounding 95. Nominating reader Teri Bolla clearly agrees with Ted: ""incredibly balanced, round, extremely smooth, shows total finesse, abundant chocolate...thick and rich on the palate.""",, Sep 2005
84.0,Costa Rica Dota Tarrazu SHB Peaberry,"The aroma displays a fruit complicated by aromatic wood tones that co-cupper Rodger Owen associated with pine and Ken with cedar. The body is light, the mouthfeel bordering on thin, the flavor delicate and tartly sweet, with sustained aromatic wood notes. Both Ken and Rodger found the finish clean, simple and rather short.",, Aug 2005
85.0,Costa Rica Organic,"Round, rich, rather simple coffee, with spicy (co-cupper Rodger Owen) and gingery (Ken) notes in the aroma. In the cup a soft, sweet acidity and buttery mouthfeel with a low-toned fruit that to Ken suggested prune and semi-sweet chocolate.",, Aug 2005
87.0,Organic Fair-Trade Costa Rica,"Muted aroma with notes that Ken called ""quietly pungent"" and co-cupper Rodger ""smoky."" Ken also found pleasantly floral top notes as well. In the cup substantial body and smooth mouthfeel; the pungent notes in the aroma reappear as nut (Rodger) or semi-sweet chocolate (Ken). Simple, sweet short finish, very slight astringency in the long.",Price: NA, Aug 2005
87.0,"Costa Rica SHB, Central Valley Monte Crisol","In the aroma intense aromatic wood notes suggested cedar to Ken, pine to co-cupper Rodger Owen. The sweet spice and low-toned fruit notes fade in a roast-influenced, rather simple cup, balanced but limited. The sweet spice suggestions surfaced again in an admirably long, resonant finish.",, Aug 2005
88.0,Organic Panama Boquete Casa Ruiz,"Intense, rather acidy aroma with vanilla-toned chocolate and fruit notes. In the cup the acidity was either sweet and lushly lively (Ken) or a touch too soft (co-cupper Rodger Owen), the flavor a bit too simple (Rodger) or intriguing in its simultaneous sensory allusions to wine and chocolate (Ken).",, Aug 2005
88.0,Costa Rica Heirloom Typica,"Deep, rich, roasty aroma with considerable complexity: Ken and co-cupper Rodger Owen found flowers (especially), cloves, fresh cedar, caramel. Both found the cup medium-bodied and intensely and pungently bittersweet, with shimmers of flowers and a low-toned fruity character that suggested pipe tobacco to Rodger and a caramelly fruit to Ken. Ken's sample finished cleanly and richly, even with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate, but Rodger drastically reduced his final rating owing to what he described as metallic, rubbery end notes, perhaps a mild roasting fault.",, Aug 2005
90.0,Panama Don Pachi Estate Geisha,"Exceptional aroma: floral notes complicated by vanilla for co-cupper Rodger Owen and lemon and pineapple for Ken. In the cup brightly but sweetly acidy and delicately smooth in mouthfeel with a subtly balanced flavor that disappointed Rodger but excited Ken with its jasmine-like floral notes and (for Ken at least) a rich, chocolaty lemon.",Price: NA, Aug 2005
90.0,Don Quijote Cafe de Costa Rica,"Ken was somewhat more enthusiastic about this classic Central American profile than co-cupper Rodger Owen, but both found lots to write about. Both found the aroma round and sweet, complicated by wine notes for Rodger and pear and a hint of cedar for Ken. In the cup both described a sweet, quietly vibrant acidity and a coffee fruit that read as black currant or slightly tart cherry for Ken and sweet pipe tobacco for Rodger. The essential sweetness carried into the short finish, tempering the slight astringency in the long.",, Aug 2005
91.0,Best of Panama Cafe Kotowa,"A simple, lyrically appealing coffee, alive with floral notes and a vivid little twist that Ken associated with spice and co-cupper Rodger Owen with cedar. Ken also cited cherry-toned fruit in the aroma that leaned toward a delicate chocolate in the cup. Fresh, cleanly sweet finish.",, Aug 2005
92.0,"Panama Esmeralda Special, 2005","Superb aroma: For Ken giddily floral with blueberry and cherry notes, for co-cupper Rodger Owen ""a beautiful burst of lemon."" In the cup crisply bright, intensely floral, sweetly and quietly lemon, then (for Ken) rounding toward an orange-toned chocolate. Slight astringency in the short finish but the floral notes had the last, lingering word in the long.",, Aug 2005
84.0,Chicago Blues Blend,"Sweet, quite smoky aroma, with floral top notes and suggestions of temperate fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup low-toned, smoky, sweet but salty, with chocolate undertones and continued hints of pear. The smoky tones carry into the finish.",, Jul 2005
85.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"A coffee that displays the more pungent side of the Yirgacheffe profile. Distinct ginger-snap notes in the aroma with suggestions of rosemary and pine. Sweeter in the cup, dominated by lemon and ginger-snap. The pine and Mediterranean herb notes resurface in the long finish.",, Jul 2005
86.0,Hawaiian Islands Blend,"Delicate, rather subdued aroma: milk chocolate, caramel, the sweeter sort of grapefruit. In the cup the caramel leans more decisively toward chocolate, with some delicate, attractive floral top notes. Slight astringency in the finish.",, Jul 2005
88.0,Colombian Supremo,"Resonant, tightly-knit, complex aroma: chocolate, cedar, leather, vanilla, raisin. In the cup delicately acidy and gently opulent: honey, vanilla, flowers. A quiet cup that rewards patience.",, Jul 2005
88.0,Breakfast Blend,"A very sweet, gently rich coffee. Spicy, perhaps slightly musty notes in the aroma lean toward a cocoaish, cedar-toned chocolate in a cup that grows more nuanced and quietly complex as it cools.",, Jul 2005
89.0,Kenya AA,"A showcase for the intense, sweetly tart sensation coffee people call acidity. The acidity is nuanced by tomato and orange notes in the aroma, softening toward chocolate and cedar in the cup. The acidity leaves a rich astringency behind in the short finish, but delicate orange notes outlast it in the long.",, Jul 2005
89.0,Kona Blend,"Subdued but rich aroma, complicated by cedar, leather and a shifty low-acid fruit, pumpkin one moment and pear the next. Simple in the cup but still rich, with a rather opulent mouthfeel and sweet dried fruit notes - raisin, apricot - leaning toward chocolate.",, Jul 2005
90.0,Breakfast Blend,"Deeply dimensioned, low-toned, quietly complex coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate, floral top notes, and a crisp temperate fruit that I read as pear carry from aroma into the cup, consolidating on chocolate in the finish.",, Jul 2005
91.0,New Guinea,"The aroma, sweetly pungent with a hint of chocolaty fruit, provided only a hint of the intensity displayed by the cup - high-toned and richly acidy, with a simple but powerful flavor complex: dry berry (aka black current), a hint of grapefruit, and rich, dry chocolate.",, Jul 2005
92.0,Kenya,"The aroma is sweet-toned and intense: cedar, semi-sweet chocolate, raisins. In the cup, dry, spicy berry, grapefruit, Bordeaux-like wine notes. The flavor notes persist in the slightly but pleasantly astringent finish.",, Jul 2005
92.0,Mocha Java Blend,"The aroma is very sweet in impression, gingery and orange-toned, the acidity gentle, the cup delicate but rich with a ginger-toned fruit that rounds and settles toward chocolate as the cup cools. Clean, chocolate-toned finish.",, Jul 2005
93.0,"Rwanda A, Gikongoro Bufcafe","Smooth, rich with a sweet complex of low-acid fruit-related tones: banana, chocolate, raisin, honey, flowers. In the cup the mouthfeel is full and supple; honey, raisin and flowers dominate and carry into a cleanly resonant finish.",, Jul 2005
94.0,Kenya AA Nyeri Fine Cup,"An essay in the difference between acidic and acidy, this commandingly dry coffee does not display a glimmer of sharpness. Tremendous range and complexity in the aroma: dry berry, high-toned cedar, orange, chocolate. The dry berry, orange and chocolate notes carry into the cup with crisp richness and fade into the finish without a hint of astringency.",, Jul 2005
92.0,Espresso Milano,"Complex, smoky/toasty aroma with chocolate and vanilla suggestions. Medium body with a roundly smooth mouthfeel. Crisply elegant in the small cup: apricot and semi-sweet chocolate. Rich, chocolate-toned short finish, slight astringency in the long, but the chocolate well outlasts it. Superb in milk: good presence, sweet, with distinct milk chocolate and vanilla tones and a long, (once more) chocolate-toned finish.",, Jun 2005
84.0,Fair-Trade Mexican Decaf,"A profile so delicate it has difficulty asserting itself. Gentle and lyric in the aroma, with sweet nut and a cherryish fruit that carry into the cup but remain subdued and without authority, a charming but distant warble in the woods.",, Jun 2005
85.0,Midnight Obsession,"The aroma is rather flat, though complicated by an interesting walnut- or maple-toned caramel character, perhaps with a hint of anise. The maple-nut-caramel character carries into the simple but balanced cup.",, Jun 2005
85.0,Indonesia Malacca Straights Pure Water Decaf,"A very heavy-bodied coffee, roasty but not burned, low-toned to the point of bluntness, with pungent cedar notes that approach semi-sweet chocolate and a hint of Mediterranean herb.",, Jun 2005
86.0,Decaf French Roast Blend,"Pungent and smoky throughout the profile, with some suggestions of semi-sweet chocolate, cedar and rosemary. In the cup the mouthfeel is lightly and pleasantly astringent, bracing rather than bitter or heavy.",, Jun 2005
87.0,Decaf Librarian’s Blend,"A light-bodied, sweetly crisp coffee. Suggestions of leather, spice and a dry, fruity chocolate in the aroma. Melodic in the cup, with sweet citrus top notes and a hint of chocolate balanced by a slight tart sharpness.",, Jun 2005
88.0,Decaf Organic Peru Chanchamayo,"Lively aroma, with fresh-cut cedar and cherry-chocolate notes. In the cup simple but deeply resonant, with hints of flowers, chocolate and cherry-leaning fruit shimmering through the gentle roastiness.",, Jun 2005
88.0,Organic Fair-Trade Decaf Mexico,"An intense, high-toned coffee with almost African character: distinct orange notes and hints of sweet spice, chocolate and flowers, lavender perhaps, in the aroma. The citrus, chocolate and lavender tones are sharper and simpler in the cup, though still intense. A tingle of astringency persists, not unpleasantly, into the finish.",, Jun 2005
89.0,Colombia Dark Roast Decaf,"Dominated by a low-toned but richly intense fruit complex that in the aroma clearly and pleasurably reads as semi-sweet chocolate. In the cup turns toward something less chocolate and more cherry perhaps, with a little pungent lean toward Mediterranean herbs. Full-bodied and deeply dimensioned throughout.",, Jun 2005
90.0,Decaf Colombia Supremo Pitalito Estate,"Mid-toned but rich, deep aroma, with fresh leather, pear, peach and milk chocolate suggestions. Simplifies a bit in the cup, undercurrents of pipe tobacco and a tartly refreshing, sweet fruit, pie cherries perhaps or kiwi.",, Jun 2005
91.0,Decaffeinated Colombian,"A lush and coherent cup. Caramel and chocolate in the aroma. The caramel sweetness deepens in the cup, complicated by a wine- or apple-cider-toned fruit and continued hints of chocolate. Full, round mouthfeel.",, Jun 2005
80.0,Colombian Supremo,"Pleasant enough aroma: rich, with a lushly fruity, brandied chocolate complication. After that pleasant overture, however, things go downhill fast. In the cup blaringly bitter and astringent, though hints of cherryish, chocolaty fruit do survive. In the finish, however, nothing at survives except a hard, overbearing astringency.",, May 2005
83.0,Go Joe J.O.E. (Java of Evolution),"The aroma is sweet but flat, with a distinct burned wood character. In the cup the burned tones come across as rather rich, bolstered by a dry spice, almost black pepper sensation. Sweetens and softens surprisingly in the finish, especially in the long.",, May 2005
84.0,Finca Buenos Aires Medium Roast Decaffeinated,"In the aroma shallow in sensation but pleasantly sweet with orange- and aromatic-wood notes. The cup is sweet, delicate, complicated by orange and a hint of milk chocolate but shadowed by flat, woody undertones. Sweet, clean short finish, but in the long the woody, flat undercurrents resurface.",, May 2005
84.0,Finca Buenos Aires Medium Roast,"In the aroma flat, rather woody, with low-toned fruit notes suggesting a sort of spicy banana. These odd but pleasant fruit notes persist in the rich though rather monotoned cup, which grows flatter and woodier as it cools. Medium body, clean, rich, rather pleasant finish.",, May 2005
84.0,Wake Up Healthy Asian Ginseng-Infused Decaf,"Richly smoky aroma, with some sweet chocolate- and apricot-toned fruit and wood tones that are just aromatic enough to escape smelling like burned old board. In the cup thin-bodied but smooth in mouthfeel, with pleasantly and delicately smoky wood tones and hints of cedar and semi-sweet chocolate. The finish is simple but clean, sweet and free of astringency, with some faint recollections of chocolate.",, May 2005
85.0,Gourmet Low Acid Coffee,"Richly balanced aroma with hints of chocolate- and sweet-spice-toned fruit. In the cup sweet, delicate, refreshingly light-bodied with some almost giddily high-toned fruit and floral notes, but betrayed by an undercurrent of cardboardy flatness. Whatever caused the cardboardy or woody sensation seems to dominate in the thin, flat finish.",, May 2005
86.0,Wake-Up Healthy Echinacea-Infused Coffee Beans,"Balanced, muted aroma with orange notes and a hint of milk chocolate. In the cup sweet, rather rich, balanced. Not much nuance, a hint of bittersweet chocolate perhaps. Pleasantly rich and sweet in the short finish; maintains sweetness in the long with little astringency.",, May 2005
86.0,Johann Wulff’s Stomach Friendly Dark Roast,"Intense, cleanly bittersweet ultra-dark roast with complex, attractive fruit notes: cherry, pear and pipe tobacco in the aroma, with the cherry-toned pipe tobacco turning toward semi-sweet chocolate in the cup. Sweet and rich in the short finish, but rather heavily astringent in the long.",, May 2005
87.0,Dark Roast Gourmet Low Acid Coffee,"A simple but very balanced, sturdy dark roast. The aroma is intense and roasty with sweet cedar notes and perhaps little flickers of chocolate and caramel. Less nuance in the cup, but roundly and richly bittersweet without a trace of burned notes and perhaps some cedar-toned fruit. Clean, complex short finish with only a hint of astringency in the long.",, May 2005
88.0,Organic Sumatran Reserve,"A complex fruitiness anchored by musty notes that read persuasively as sweet earth immediately identify this coffee as a traditional style Sumatra. The fruit reads most clearly as chocolate in the aroma, with tickles of raisin, citrus, perhaps papaya. In the cup sweet and bracingly earthy with a tart twist that suggests pineapple or grapefruit. Medium body. Rounds from short finish to long in a sweet, gently rich trajectory.",, May 2005
80.0,Brazil (O cafe forte do Brasil),"In the aroma rich and simple, with musty/medicinal notes that aspire to chocolate but don't quite get there. In the cup full-bodied but gritty in mouthfeel, with dominating fermented fruit notes that can read as raisin or dried apricot and semi-sweet chocolate. Sweet in the short finish, astringent in the long.",, Apr 2005
82.0,Brazil Cerrado Dark Roast,"The structure and aromatics are dominated by the impact of an aggressively dark roast. Roasty and neutral in the aroma with subdued charred cedar tones and rather remote suggestions of fruit and nut. When hot the cup is burned and rather soapy, with perhaps some spice and cedar-toned chocolate. As it cools, however, the soapy tones recede and the chocolate intensifies, turns distinctly semi-sweet.",, Apr 2005
84.0,Brazilian,"In the aroma intensely but cleanly roasty: pungent cedar with faint fruit undertones: papaya and apricot. In the cup the aggressive charred cedar tones continue to dominate, but the fruit becomes more explicit, rounding and sweetening toward chocolate. Sweet chocolate tones buffer the astringency in the short finish, but in the long the astringency turns rather heavy and tongue-coating.",, Apr 2005
85.0,Brazilian Prima Qualita,"Low-key but quietly complex aroma: mild chocolate, richly spicy fruit that reads perhaps as papaya. In the cup good body, round mouthfeel, quietly balanced. The fruit and chocolate sharpens a bit from sweet to bittersweet, influenced by a slight mustiness that reads legitimately as a nutty spice. Rich short finish, slightly astringent long.",, Apr 2005
87.0,Brazil Cerrado Capim Branco,"Sweetly and gently acidy medium-roasted coffee, with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate in the aroma and sweet lemon and tomato in the cup. Rather shallow in sensory dimension, but softens and deepens as the cup cools, revealing floral hints. Balanced finish with a gentle astringency buffered by sweetness.",, Apr 2005
87.0,Brazil Vivenda das Aguas,"Gently pungent in the aroma: semi-sweet chocolate, cedar, a hint of pruny fruit and Mediterranean herbs. In the cup quietly attractive structure, with a balanced bittersweetness and a shimmer of acidity, but little nuance. Clean, rich, long finish.",, Apr 2005
87.0,Brazil,"The aroma is very sweet in impression with cocoa and walnut notes and a slight mustiness that reads as carnal fruit ? apricot perhaps. In the cup giddily sweet, but with a continued undertone of musty sharpness that continues to read as a cocoa-toned apricot, but less convincingly so than in the aroma. Very sweet finish.",, Apr 2005
88.0,Brazil Araucaria,"Complex, intensely deep aroma, complicated by peach, chocolate and a hint of cedar. Sweet and high-toned in the cup, where the peach turns toward floral and the chocolate toward cocoa. Rich, sweet short finish, though a slight astringency distracts in the cup and resurfaces in the long finish.",, Apr 2005
91.0,Brazil Cerrado Light Roast,"Subtle nut and dry berry tones in the aroma, sweet in impression. In the cup silky and delicate, with a crisp but gently rounded acidity, the nut and berry tones deepening toward chocolate. Sweet short finish; slightly dry and astringent in the long.",, Apr 2005
91.0,Organic Brazil,"Quietly but giddily complex. Fruit notes read as a sort of spicy papaya and semi-sweet chocolate in the aroma. The cup reveals dramatic floral notes with the fruit reading as orange, though still with a semi-sweet chocolate tendency that carries from the rich short finish to clean, lingering long.",, Apr 2005
92.0,Brazil Yellow Bourbon,"A gently acidy coffee, with a melodic sweetness and delicate complexity: sweet tomatoes and milk chocolate, perhaps a hint of fresh-cut cedar and a shimmer of jasmine running from aroma through cup to the clean, refreshing finish.",, Apr 2005
87.0,Marcafe Crema Bar Espresso,"Lush, complex aroma: wine, raisins, dark chocolate, nuts, spice. In the small cup full body, buttery mouthfeel, and a distinct raisin-chocolate flavor with slight salty undertones. The raisin-chocolate carries into the rich finish, as does the shadow saltiness. In milk the chocolate rounds and sweetens richly from raisins to cherries with a whiff of fresh leather and a persistent hint of salt.",, Mar 2005
82.0,Organic Espresso Sierra,"Subdued cedar and prune in the aroma. In the small cup medium body and lean mouthfeel. In flavor slightly smoky, slightly sharp, cedar-toned and rather shallow, with a suggestion of fruit and semi (very semi)-sweet chocolate. Shortish and rather astringent finish. Sweetens and rounds in milk, with some fruity chocolate softening the cedar and smoke.",, Mar 2005
84.0,Fellowship of the Bean Espresso,"A pleasant but rather predictable American-style espresso blend. Subdued chocolate and fruit in the aroma, medium body with a somewhat lean mouthfeel, smoky and pungently cedar-toned flavor with a little shimmer of dry cocoa. Softens and sweetens in milk to a cedarish chocolate with a hint of fresh leather.",, Mar 2005
85.0,Organic Occidental Decaf Espresso,"Delicate but attractive aroma complicated by chocolate and low-acid tropical fruit notes. In the small cup medium body and a rather lean mouthfeel. The flavor is simple, cedar-toned, pungent-sweet, with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Rich in the short finish, a bit heavy in the long. In milk rather delicate, sweet-cedar-toned with a continuing hint of chocolate.",, Mar 2005
85.0,Piccolo Mondo Espresso Blend,"A rather aggressively roasted espresso. Delicate floral and fruit notes complicate an aroma that is toasty and almost burned. In the small cup medium to full body, creamy mouthfeel, and a flavor dominated by a gentle but slightly sharp bittersweetness. The complicating fruit notes are a bit too dry to read as chocolate. Sweetens and rounds in milk but never quite blooms.",, Mar 2005
87.0,Sweet Spot Espresso Blend,"Deep, chocolate-toned aroma. In the small cup medium to full in body, in flavor sweetly cedar-toned with dry chocolate and apricot complication. The short finish is rich, the long fades toward astringency. Rounds nicely in milk, displaying a fine balance of crisp cedar and chocolate-toned fruit.",, Mar 2005
87.0,Hi-Octane Organic Espresso,"Deep, gently pungent aroma resonating with chocolate and low-acid tropical fruit notes. In the small cup the body is full, the mouthfeel a touch rough, the flavor slightly sharp and roasty with cedar and a hint of chocolate. The finish is rich and mildly astringent. Milk softens and sweetens the profile, nicely developing the implicit chocolate and fruit, though never completely plumping out the mouthfeel.",, Mar 2005
88.0,Bossa Nova Espresso,"Chocolate and toast show in the rather subdued aroma. In the small cup the body is medium and the mouthfeel slightly lean, with a simple but attractive pungent/sweet character complicated by a cocoa or dry chocolate. Rich, semi-sweet chocolate finish. In milk balanced and crisply sweet, with the chocolate retaining its dry authority.",, Mar 2005
89.0,Organic Shade-Grown Espresso Occidental,"Delicate aroma, sweet with milk chocolate innuendo. In the small cup medium in body, smooth in mouthfeel, cedar-toned and gently bittersweet in flavor with a lean toward chocolate. Rich finish with a continuing shimmer of chocolate. Relaxes but doesn't quite bloom in milk; remains balanced and reticent with understated complications: fresh leather, cedar, raisiny chocolate.",, Mar 2005
89.0,Northern Italian Roast Organic,"Superb front end to this blend: velvety crema, the aroma deep but delicately and crisply chocolate- and vanilla-toned. In the small cup the body is full, the flavor caramelly and crisp but slightly salty and a bit shallow. Blooms with discreet elegance in milk, complicated by a dry but opulent chocolate.",, Mar 2005
92.0,Organic Decaf Espresso,"Deep, sweetly pungent aroma with echoes of apricot or papaya. The mouthfeel is a bit rough but pleasantly so. The small cup is rich and sweet with a tightly-knit, deeply fruity complexity complicated by hints of cedar and toast. The sweet richness persists from short through long finish. Impressive range of sensation in milk: crisply sweet yet lushly chocolate.",, Mar 2005
93.0,"Organic Espresso, N. Italian Style","A superb, versatile blend. The aroma is deep with chocolate and tropical fruit tones (banana?), the mouthfeel buttery and the body full, the small cup sweetly cedar toned with a lush, very slightly fermented fruit that reads as a rich raisin- and floral-toned chocolate. The finish is resonant and long with a low-key, pleasantly bracing astringency. In milk the shot rounds and sweetens without losing identity or authority.",, Mar 2005
93.0,Organic Fair Trade Espresso,"Delicate aroma, toasty with distinct raisin and chocolate notes. Deepens in the small cup; the mouthfeel is buttery and the raisin and chocolate notes turn lavishly rich with a tickle of brandyish ferment. Long, resonant finish. Transforms beautifully in milk; the chocolate intensifies without turning trite or candyish, while the fruit seems to lift and reveal lighter, brighter tones of melon and flowers.",, Mar 2005
93.0,Esmeralda Special Panama,"Intense, high-toned aroma, complex but tightly knit: lemon, dry berry, flowers (tea rose?), milk chocolate. The acidity is powerful but roundly balanced, the body surprisingly full, the flavor explosive: rose water, sweet pipe tobacco, chocolate, all enveloped in a lemony richness. Lemon and chocolate notes carry into the finish, where they soften and enliven a slight astringency.",, Feb 2005
92.0,Espresso Nuevo,"Rich, deeply fruity papaya-toned chocolate in the aroma. In the small cup the body is medium in weight but smooth and balanced in mouthfeel; the flavor crisp but resonant, with a tightly knit complexity: wine, chocolate, cedar, perhaps pear. The finish is heavy but smooth and rich, with a recollection of chocolate. Sweetens and blooms in milk without losing its crisp elegance: fresh leather, pear, mint, cherry-toned chocolate.",, Feb 2005
83.0,Zimbabwe,"A potentially fine coffee compromised by mild mildew tones probably picked up during storage. The aroma is flat, potatoey and faded. In the cup, however, sweet, lushly winy tones compete with the musty hardness, a combination that some coffee drinkers may find attractive. The finish is rich and clean.",, Feb 2005
84.0,Tanzania Zanzibar Peaberry,"Smoothly pungent, roasty presentation. Cedar, prune and raisin notes contribute to a pleasingly complex aroma, but the roast dominates the aromatics in the cup, relieved mainly by subtle but distinct floral top notes. Astringent though rich in the short finish, floral-toned in the long.",, Feb 2005
86.0,"Kilimanjaro Peaberry, Full City","Richly and deeply roasty in the aroma with some fruit complication - fresh plum perhaps. The roast gently dominates in the cup, bittersweet, with undercurrents of fresh plum and hints of chocolate and flowers. Richly roasty in the short finish, slightly astringent in the long.",, Feb 2005
87.0,Bantu Blend,"Simple but deeply rich aroma, with a distinct raisin/prune complication. The cup displays a gentle acidity wrapped in a deep, fundamental sweetness, with muted notes of dusk-blooming flowers, papaya, caramel, raisins. Simple but long, clean finish.",, Feb 2005
87.0,Tanzania,"A simple but refreshing coffee: rather high-toned, delicate in body, gently acidy, with coffee fruit that reads as cherry with a sweet-pipe-tobacco twist. The finish is rich, clean, and surprisingly long.",Price: NA, Feb 2005
88.0,"Zambia AA Plus, Lupili Estate","A changeable coffee both as it cools and from session to session. Constants are a crisp coffee fruit that probably best reads as pear or cherry, a smoky, spicy chocolate sensation, and distinct floral notes that at times resemble an elegant, heady lilac. The finish tends to be heavy, but as the cup cools the long finish is finely floral.",, Feb 2005
89.0,Zimbabwe AA,"A low-toned but deceptively lyric coffee. Rich in both aroma and cup: in aroma pear, caramel, and hints of flowers and cinnamon; in cup caramel, yellow fruit (peach?) and chocolate with hints of flowers and dry berry. The finish is agreeably chocolate-toned, particularly as the cup cools, although slightly heavy.",, Feb 2005
90.0,Rwanda Gorilla Blend,"Low-toned fruit (peach?), semi-sweet chocolate and fresh-cut cedar notes in the aroma. The cup is delicate but lush, enlivened by a softly tart acidity and complicated by continued fruit (cherry, peach) and semi-sweet chocolate notes. The finish is simple but sweetly clean.",, Feb 2005
91.0,Tanzania Peaberry,"A tribute to the upside of slightly fermented fruit tones in coffee. Sweet and completely free of bitterness or saltiness, the ferment comes across as sweetly orange-toned in the aroma with a crisp hint of cedar, in the cup as a lushly ripe papaya- and peach-toned fruitiness that leans toward chocolate but never quite surrenders its tropical juiciness.",, Feb 2005
91.0,Rwanda,"Everything explodes near the top of the profile in this intensely fragrant coffee. The aroma is rich with floral, sweet lemon and lush chocolate notes. Exhilarating floral tones dominate the cup, but to simply call them floral understates their complexity: This is a whole symphonic garden of flowers. The body is light but the impression and mouthfeel delicate and buoyant. Only the very slightest astringency in the finish mars this exceptional coffee.",, Feb 2005
93.0,Tanzania Peaberry,"In the aroma this relatively light-roasted coffee is caramelly but smoky, with cherry and sweet pipe tobacco notes. In the cup it is delicate yet robust and very sweet, with a smoothly rich acidity, heavy body, and a giddy complexity anchored around wine and cherry tones with hints of smoke and milk chocolate. The finish is clean, long and sweet.",, Feb 2005
91.0,Cafe Quindio Gourmet Colombian,"Complex but balanced. The acidity is sweet and winy, the body medium but round in mouthfeel, the general impression delicate but rich. Milk chocolate, fruit (lemon, apricot, papaya) and a slight cedar pungency run through the profile from aroma to the pleasingly light-footed finish.",, Jan 2005
83.0,La Mattina Sumatra,"Intensely musty, aka ""earthy."" In the aroma, the musty tones read as a sort of ripe apricot rolled in earth and chocolate, but in the cup the mustiness flattens, simplifies, and dominates before softening slightly in the rather salty finish.",, Jan 2005
84.0,Decaf Sumatra,"Muted aroma with roasty pine and spice notes and a hint of low-key fruit. Delicate in the cup, with distinct and explicit spice notes ? cinnamon, nutmeg perhaps, with a continuing hint of apricot-toned fruit.",, Jan 2005
85.0,Sumatra,"Agreeable but a bit lazy in the aroma: spice, cedar, with the barest hint of apricot-toned chocolate. In the cup sweet, balanced gently rich, still dominated by cedar and smoke, but the chocolate-toned fruit, barely perceptible in the aroma, opens and blooms nicely.",, Jan 2005
87.0,Wild Horses Sumatra Decaf,"Agreeably dominated by the roast. Deeply and gently charred cedar in aroma and cup, with hints of low-key fruit ? banana or papaya ? and chocolate. The astringency in the finish is nicely wrapped in a rich memory of fruit and chocolate.",, Jan 2005
87.0,Sumatra,"At its best in the aroma: rich, deep, smoky, cedary, with undercurrents of sweet dark chocolate. Crisply bittersweet in the cup, with rich, slightly charred cedar and hints of spice-toned cherry. Sweet and chocolaty in the short finish, though rather sharply astringent in the long.",, Jan 2005
87.0,Organic Fair-Trade Sumatra French Roast,"Rich, low-key, smoky, with an agreeably mild musty ferment that reads in aroma and cup as raisins and semi-sweet chocolate. In the aroma complex, in the cup balanced but a bit simple; surprisingly clean, soft finish.",, Jan 2005
87.0,Organic Fair-Trade Sumatra Gayoland,"In the aroma cedar, spice, papaya, and a hint of semi-sweet chocolate. Delicate in the cup, with very sweet citrus notes, pink grapefruit perhaps, and a distinct cedar character with a continuing hint of chocolate. Rather heavy finish for such a light-footed coffee.",, Jan 2005
88.0,Sulawesi,"Lushly high-toned, remarkably complex aroma: flowers (tea-rose?), temperate fruit (pear perhaps), milk chocolate. Slumps toward a lower-key bittersweet character in the cup with only occasional glimpses of chocolate, but the giddy floral top notes persist. Slightly shallow finish.",, Jan 2005
88.0,Sumatra Mandheling Light Roast,"Delicately rich and comfortably round, dominated by a winy ferment that reads as spice, mango, chocolate and cedar in the aroma, cocoa and spice in the cup. Rich finish with only the slightest tickle of astringency.",, Jan 2005
89.0,Sumatra Mandheling Grade 1,"Deeply and opulently sweet, big-bodied, with a bracing, bitter edge of spice, herb and cedar. The cup reveals undercurrents of wine-toned fruit. The short finish is rich, the long leaves us with a slight astringent saltiness.",Price: NA, Jan 2005
90.0,Sumatra,"Powerful and complex. Extraordinary aroma: spice, a fresh, nostril-tingling cedar, low-toned tropical fruit, bananas perhaps. In the cup a tingle of sweet acidity, more cedar, and fruit that turns sweetly and richly tart - grapefruit, tamarind. Memories of this complexity persist in the finish, softening a mild astringency. Reader Amy Bowser nominated this coffee, calling it ""clean but with huge depth and character.""",, Jan 2005
92.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"This unusually light roasted Sumatra is very sweet and richly high-toned, and exceptional in its lush but delicate expression of the natural character of coffee fruit and flower. The fruit suggests cherry leaning toward unsweetened chocolate, but those who have visited coffee farms will recognize it as the taste of the coffee fruit itself, with shimmers of jasmine-like coffee flower. The short finish is cherryish and rich, though the long leaves us with just the slightest hint of astringency.",Price: NA, Jan 2005
87.0,Espresso – a.k.a. Silver Beans,"In the aroma low-toned, with cedar and papaya notes leaning toward chocolate. In the small cup the body is heavy with a pleasantly rough mouthfeel, the flavor rich with continuing suggestions of cedar and papaya-toned chocolate. The short finish maintains the chocolaty richness, but the long concludes with a hint of saltiness and astringency. The generally heavy profile softens nicely in milk while maintaining a pleasing depth and power, though the woody cedar tones seem to hinder the chocolate from fully sweetening and blooming.",, Dec 2004
92.0,Breakfast Blend,"A coffee that demonstrates the virtue of a dash of cleanly and sweetly fermented fruit taste in a blend. The aroma is low-toned and caramelly, with smoky and raisiny chocolate suggestions. The cup is roundly rich with a tingle of fermented fruit that reads as a raisin- or brandied-cherry-toned chocolate.",, Dec 2004
92.0,Vermont Country Blend,"Delicate but deeply dimensioned aroma: distinct milk chocolate, hints of aromatic cedar and low-toned, temperate fruit: peach, perhaps, or apricot. Almost sugary sweet in the cup, light-bodied, with a tight-knit complexity centered on peach- or cherry-toned milk chocolate. The finish is short but refreshing.",, Dec 2004
83.0,Organic Midnight Sun,"The roast dominates the coffee in this extreme dark-roast profile. Intensely but roundly and sweetly charred in the aroma, with a gingery, cedarish complication. The cup is dominated by charred tones that remain just on the pleasantly rich, aromatic cedar side of flat-out burned.",, Dec 2004
86.0,Kona Mountain Estate,"The aroma is rich and rather deep with apple, pipe tobacco and semi-sweet chocolate notes. In the cup lively when hot, but almost immediately contracts in sensory range, turning monotoned and heavy, though still with pleasant allusions to the dry apple and chocolate notes.",, Dec 2004
87.0,El Salvador Santa Leticia,"In the aroma rather subdued but complex with chocolate, cherry and a bracing whiff of cedar. The cup is delicate when hot, with a lovely, lyric balance of sweetness and a gentle shimmer of acidity complicated by slightly tart, cherryish chocolate notes. As the cup cools the profile simplifies and flattens, however. I had this coffee rated 90 until it cooled.",, Dec 2004
87.0,Organic Cafe Peru,"A touch of fruit ferment both pleasantly complicates and slightly mars this interesting coffee. In the cup the ferment turns the acidity pleasantly winy and bends the fruit toward a rich, brandied chocolate with raisin and caramel innuendo. The long finish is marred by a troublesome bitterness, however, probably owing to the same ferment.",, Dec 2004
87.0,Brazil Fazenda Cachoeira,"In the aroma high-toned and delicate, complicated by sweet spice and suggestions of flowers and chocolate. The cup is low in acidity and dominated by a crisp nutty fruit, raisins and walnuts perhaps, with a continuing shimmer of floral chocolate. A very slight astringency surfaces as the cup cools.",, Dec 2004
87.0,Colombia La Vereda,"A balanced, sweet, endearingly simple cup, refreshing and direct without drama or complexity. Low-toned fruit, prune perhaps, and a hint of flowers. Slight astringency in the otherwise long, agreeable finish.",, Dec 2004
88.0,Organic Mexican La Trinidad,"In the aroma richly low-toned: cedar, sweet spice, with a hint of milk chocolate. In the cup the acidity is muted, the flavor sweet with a balancing touch of bitterness, while the milk chocolate blooms opulently. The chocolate persists in the resonant finish.",, Dec 2004
89.0,Guatemala El Cuervo,"Low-key, richly pungent aroma: raisins, dried cherries, chocolate. In the cup gently pungent, softly acidy, with a tightly knit complexity, again suggesting dried fruit - raisins, cherries, with a touch of chocolate.",, Dec 2004
90.0,Brazil Fazenda Lagoa Estates,"The low-toned aroma is charged with cocoa and spicy fruit (apricot?) notes. In the cup a dry-yet-sweet, almost sugary fig-like character dominates, enlivened by a soft shimmer of acidity. The finish is sweet, rich and long with chocolate and dry fruit notes.",, Dec 2004
90.0,Colombia Supremo Pitalito Estate,"A tribute to the tartly sweet, invigorating sensation coffee insiders call acidity. In the aroma richly fruity and orange-toned; in the cup giddy with rich, high-toned acidity laced with fruit suggesting oranges and tart cherries. The acidity softens and sweetens voluptuously in the finish.",, Dec 2004
90.0,Colombia Toledo Labateca,"A complex and interesting coffee rather than a perfect one. The aroma is subdued but round and sweet with a distinct cherry-toned milk chocolate. In the cup the acidity is soft but the fruit turns bracing and tartly sweet -- think the pleasantly sour sweetness of pie cherries. As the cup cools the fruit softens once again, revealing a refined but almost candyish chocolate character.",, Dec 2004
82.0,Nicaragua Hacienda Santa Clotilde,A past-crop green coffee that faded badly in storage before roasting. The dominating character is a pungency that reads as sweet pine in the aroma and a rather salty spice in the cup.,, Nov 2004
87.0,Honduras Tutule La Sociedad,"Low-toned and pungent, bittersweet rather than acidy. Cedar and chocolate hints in the aroma; in the cup a deep, pruny (or perhaps dried fig) fruit and crisp, dry berry notes, with perhaps a little rounding suggestion of chocolate.",, Nov 2004
88.0,Nicaragua Buena Vista,"Low-key and rich. In the aroma fresh-cut cedar and caramel, with a shimmer of crisply temperate fruit, pear perhaps. In the cup the low-toned acidity is sweet, the mouthfeel round. The cup is a bit monotoned when hot, but as it cools it opens up beautifully, revealing a deep, black-cherry-toned fruit. The finish is slightly heavy.",, Nov 2004
90.0,El Salvador Los Naranjos,"Aroma and finish are balanced and understated, almost simple, but the cup transcends limitation with its big-bodied, sweet-toned opulence. There is nuance here: roast-influenced cedar and dark chocolate in the aroma, caramel and perhaps raisin in the cup, but the sensory payoff is the fatly silky body and round, resonant depth.",, Nov 2004
90.0,Cup of Excellence El Salvador Brasil,"Sweet, low-toned, resonant in dimension. Distinct raisin and milk chocolate notes in the aroma. In the cup big-bodied and creamy, with a tightly woven, deep-toned, caramel- and chocolate-toned complexity.",, Nov 2004
91.0,Nicaragua Los Delirios,"A bold, sweetly acidy coffee with a shifting, subtle complexity. In the aroma low-toned, lushly rich fruit (apricot, papaya, even banana) leaning toward milk chocolate. In the cup brighter and higher-toned, with lemon, flowers and continued suggestions of milk chocolate. Rounds and richens as it cools, the fruit tones landing somewhere near cherry.",, Nov 2004
92.0,El Salvador Las Nubitas,"An unusual bittersweet, gently spicy tendency runs from aroma through finish. The aroma is caramelly but pungent, with a hint of milk chocolate. The cup is low-toned and dominated by a sweet/sour/bitter fruit; tamarind and lemon perhaps. In the cup the background milk chocolate is more pronounced, rounding the bright fruit. The finish is slightly but richly astringent.",, Nov 2004
92.0,El Salvador Las Nubitas,"A delicately intense, sweetly acidy cup. In the aroma spicy and floral with milk chocolate undertones. Perfectly balanced and lyric in the cup, with floral notes and a sweet, high-toned temperate fruit, pear or cherry. The chocolate resurfaces in the long, gently astringent finish.",Price: NA, Nov 2004
92.0,La Corona Blend,"The aroma is low-toned but resonant with leather and fruit-toned chocolate. The acidity is rich and smoothly integrated, the mouthfeel round and supple. The chocolate declaration in the aroma is even more pronounced in the cup, but fruitier, more opulent.",, Nov 2004
93.0,Nicaragua Madriz Jose Alfredo Zeledon Cooperative,"Delicately rich in aroma and cup. The clean, elegant fruit suggests peach in the aroma and cherry in the cup, with a little swoon toward chocolate. The refined acidity rounds and sweetens beautifully as the cup cools, deepening toward wine.",, Nov 2004
94.0,El Salvador Montecarlos Peaberry,"Sweet, low-toned, deep, to turn metaphorical, a quiet, smiling, radiant coffee. In the aroma caramel and peach-toned fruit. The peach notes carry into the cup, joined by exhilarating suggestions of flowers and a hint of chocolate. The chocolate turns more explicit in the fine, rich finish.",Price: NA, Nov 2004
94.0,El Salvador Montecarlos Tablon Crater,"Understated but quietly distinctive. The aroma is round, caramelly and (quite literally) buttery; patience may turn up little cedar and chocolate revelations as well. The butter and caramel notes carry into the cup, where the fruity chocolate intensifies. The short finish is deep, sweet and rich; a memory of chocolate resurfaces in the long.",, Nov 2004
93.0,"Kenya AA, 2004 Crop","Sweetly high-toned and delicate, this melodic coffee makes up in nuanced top notes what it may lack in force. The exquisite aroma is complexly and sweetly citrusy - Meyer lemon, pink grapefruit - with a shimmer of roses. The sweet citrus notes carry into the cup, joined by crisp dry berry and black currant.",, Oct 2004
91.0,Papua New Guinea,"A gentle, sweet coffee whose balance and understated depth and completeness genuinely merits the word elegant. A delicate, dry chocolate flits through the profile from aroma through finish; the acidity is soft, rich, and sweet with pink grapefruit notes.",, Oct 2004
88.0,Tanzania Peaberry,"This coffee displayed a very slight ""old crop"" (faded, musty-mildew) character that caused co-cupper Christy Thorns to drop her score to 86. Ken (90) felt this shadow defect hardly mattered, however, given the cup's ""almost effervescent delicacy, with tickles of sweet cocoa, pipe-tobacco and caramel."" Christy offered a similar reading of the cup, but with less enthusiasm: ""Although a hint of mustiness somewhat masks the sweetness of the cup, tobacco, cedar and black pepper give this coffee some charm.""",, Oct 2004
89.0,Kenya Muthiani,"The roast dominates the coffee, but agreeably so. Co-cupper Christy Thorns: ""Multi-layered with roasty bitter chocolate, stewed prunes, raisins, and sweet spice. (89)"" Ken: ""Rich, deeply roasty and bittersweet, excellent dimension, dry berry and floral tones shimmer behind the roastiness. Chocolate toward the finish. (88)"" Christy concludes that, although the profile may lack top-notes, a ""syrupy body makes for a powerhouse of a cup.""",, Oct 2004
88.0,Ethiopia Sidamo Organic,"Although co-cupper Christy Thorns (87) felt the Ethiopia citrus and floral notes turned ""somewhat passive"" under the impact of the roast, she praised the ""complex aromatics of ginger, clove and toasted grain"" and a spicy finish. Ken also found spice notes also in the aroma (black pepper, clove), but particularly admired the cup for its round mouthfeel and ""juicy and sweet but vegetal"" character, ""a bit like biting into a ripe plum and tasting the skin and the flesh at the same time."" What we can take away from all of this is a coffee with less floral and citrus character than a classic wet-processed Ethiopia, but with more spice and tingle.",, Oct 2004
89.0,Kenya Kii Cooperative,"Co-cupper Christy Thorns reduced her score to 89 for this Kenya because she felt its chocolate and spice inclinations were not characteristic of the origin. Ken started at 88 and stayed there. He had no problem admiring the chocolate-inclining sweet citrus character he read in aroma and cup, but felt that ultimately the cup was a bit too simple for a top rating.",, Oct 2004
90.0,Organic Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"A striking and distinctive coffee. Co-cupper Christy Thorns (89) admired its complex aromatics: ""dried apricot, orange zest, clove, citronella."" Ken (90) found a gingery chocolate and lemon that for him was unusual and surprising, which may be why he was slightly more willing than Christy to forgive a slight, shadow salty cling as the cup cooled.",, Oct 2004
90.0,Kenya Gaaki Central,"Ken (91) admired this coffee a bit more than co-cupper Christy Thorns (88), who praised its ""gentle grapefruit-like acidity and a nicely rounded, sweet and berry finish"" but didn't carry on about it much. For his part, Ken particularly admired this coffee's citrus-toned acidity, which he found sweet, rounded, and ""profoundly rich and cleanly and elegantly wine-like.""",, Oct 2004
91.0,Ethiopian,"For both Ken (90) and co-cupper Christy Thorns (91), extraordinary aroma: For Christy ""freshly grown ginger, orange peel, apricot, mint and lemon."" Ken stressed the ""caramelly fruit that transforms completely into chocolate."" In the cup, smooth, creamy mouthfeel and, for Ken, a character ""sweetly and deeply tart - dark chocolate and lemon.""",, Oct 2004
90.0,Kenya Peaberry,"Both Ken (92) and co-cupper Christy Thorns (88) remarked on an odd (and for Ken an interesting) character to the aroma. Christy called it ""stewed berry,"" Ken - a rich, almost meaty impression - Dijon mustard and ripe tomatoes.? In the cup Christy found ""the acidity a bit timid, [though] the sugary sweetness of the finish more than compensates."" Ken admired the ""sweet, gently tart fruitiness"" of the acidity, finding it more elegant than timid.",, Oct 2004
90.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"Co-cupper Christy Thorns' (90) reading was precise and explicit: ""The aromatics of this coffee undulate from desert lime, orange peel, lemon zest to eucalyptus and jasmine blossom. These characteristics do not carry over into the cup, however, but instead a delicate candied sweetness and roasted nut flavor dominate with a hint of ginger in the finish."" Ken (90), just as positive but less specific, was content to praise a rich wine, fruit and floral character. Either way, a complex cup with great aromatic richness and range.",, Oct 2004
91.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"The roast takes equal place with the coffee in the success of this darker roasted Yirgacheffe, proving, in co-cupper Christy Thorns' (91) words, ""the amazing roasting range that a fine Ethiopian coffee can withstand."" Christy finds ""stone fruit, licorice, black pepper, citrus, rose petal and lavender"" in the aroma and cup. Ken (90) also admired the rich floral and sweet citrus character.",, Oct 2004
86.0,Greenwich Blue 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain,"Low-key, sweetly pungent aroma: pear, caramel, chocolate. In the cup rich, roundly full-bodied, with plum and chocolate notes. A slight astringent sharpness tends to shadow the lush aromatics, however, particularly in the finish.",, Sep 2004
86.0,Organic Fair Trade Sumatra,"In the aroma liquored and slightly fermented fruit are accompanied by dark chocolate notes, all of which mask hints of coffee oils going slightly rancid. A heavy body with gritty mouthfeel dominates the cup. Long, rather oily finish. (Lindsey Bolger)",, Sep 2004
86.0,Organic Fair Trade Mexico Pluma Hidalgo,A refreshingly medium roast delivers a dry fragrance of crisp linen scented with geranium that develops into wet aromas of spiced chocolate and browned sugar sweetness with wisps of burned match-like sulfur. Pleasing heft and complexity in the cup. A muscular coffee with a surprisingly crisp and clean finish.,, Sep 2004
86.0,Organic Fair Trade Ethiopian Yirgacheffe,"Intense aromatics of coffee blossom (imagine jasmine, gardenia and lime), laced with milk chocolate, dried orange peel, bees' wax and lemon. While many Yirgacheffes display flourishes of mint, here oregano is the more dominant herbal note. If this coffee is big and robust in fragrance and aroma, the cup is quiet and a bit timid - a contradiction that adds to the appeal of this delicately balanced coffee. (Lindsey Bolger)",, Sep 2004
87.0,Fair Trade Blend,"Big, pungent, flame-born phenols boldly emerge in the dry fragrance. In the hot aroma, lush and mouth-watering double chocolate cake. A dense and chewy coffee with an elegant, silky velvet finish - surprisingly sweet for a coffee pushed to its limits during the roast. (Lindsey Bolger)",, Sep 2004
87.0,Organic Fair Trade Ethiopian Arabian Nights,"Minty and fresh tobacco notes in the dry fragrance. In the hot aroma dry fruit notes of prune and wisps of spicy sweet chocolate. In the cup the dark roasting amplifies body, but mutes many of the attributes specific to this elegant origin. For me this coffee ultimately suggested a lovely old-master painting, sparkling with jewel-toned detail that centuries of darkened varnish have dulled. Nevertheless, it displays the depth and intensity of a well-crafted and classic French roast. (Lindsey Bolger)",, Sep 2004
88.0,Organic Fair Trade Ethiopian Harrar,"Dry fragrance: lemon, flowers and freshly laundered linen. In the hot aroma dark molasses and licorice on the pour, rich ripe fruit and milk chocolate in the break. While the floral, citrus and deep-red fruit notes remain intact from first sip through last (a neat trick in such a dark roast) these flavors assemble themselves differently with each taste as the cup cools. Complex and beautifully structured cup (Lindsey Bolger).",, Sep 2004
88.0,Organic Fair Trade Sumatra Gayoland,"Sweet, rich, with an impressive balance of dry acidy notes and sweetness. A combination of slightly fermented fruit and musty earthiness reads here as a fine intrigue of papaya, raisins and chocolate.",, Sep 2004
88.0,Organic Fair Trade Ethiopian Yirgacheffe,"Chocolate and delicately intense lemon notes carry decisively from aroma through cup to finish. The cup is integrated and harmonious, with a softly sweet acidity and a slight herby twist to the lemon.",, Sep 2004
90.0,Organic Fair-Trade National Wildlife Decaf,"Balanced and classic. The acidity is sweet and well integrated, the mouthfeel round and cleanly smooth, the flavor rich and straightforward with coffee fruit (the closest analogy is red cherry) that hints gently at milk chocolate. Long, resonant finish.",, Sep 2004
92.0,Daterra Farm Espresso: North Italian Style,"In the small cup deeply sweet, with a heavy, buttery mouthfeel and carnal fruit tones: papaya, mango, bittersweet chocolate. Exceptional in milk: very sweet with chocolate-toned fruit of almost lyric lift and complexity balanced by a dry, authoritative finish.",Price: NA, Aug 2004
90.0,"Ethiopia Yirgacheffe, Grade 2","Delicate and refined aroma: flowers, oranges and a hint of fresh-cut cedar. The cup is light-bodied, sweetly tart, refreshingly floral- and fruit toned with the pure, literal character of the flower and fruit of the coffee tree.",, Aug 2004
92.0,Thiriku Cooperative Kenya AA Nyeri,"Bright but sweet, lyrically and complexly high-toned. Lemon, cherry, black currant in the aroma. In the cup cherry, tart berries, sweet grapefruit, even a rounding hint of milk chocolate.",, Aug 2004
90.0,Java Estate Peaberry,"Superb aroma: rich, deep, pungently chocolate. The chocolate turns more intensely pungent, almost pine-toned in the cup, balanced by sweet, lush undercurrents of fruit.",, Aug 2004
86.0,Organic/Fair Trade Nicaragua Segovia,Deeply roasty in the aroma with grapefruit top notes and apricot and spicy chocolate undercurrents. In the cup sweet and complexly rich with chocolate and a caramelly fruit. A slight sharpness in the cup turns distinctly astringent and bitter in the finish.,, Aug 2004
87.0,Nicaragua Bourbon,"Deep, rich, quietly complex aroma, with hints of cherry-toned fruit, chocolate, and leather. Loses its smile and turns quite serious in the cup, with a fullish body and powerful but sweet acidity. Once past the aroma, little nuance.",, Aug 2004
87.0,Nicaragua 15 de Septiembre Organic,"Roundly and sweetly pungent aroma, rich with walnut and cherry-toned chocolate. Simplifies slightly in the cup, but remains buoyant and cherry-toned, a giggly, meadowy sort of coffee. Light-footed but rich finish.",, Aug 2004
87.0,Nicaragua SHG Guayacan,"Mid-toned, pungent aroma with fresh cedar, cherry, and chocolate-caramel notes. In the cup delicate, roundly sweet, with floral and high-toned fruit notes -- think floral-scented caramels.",, Aug 2004
87.0,Santa Fe Plantation Nicargua Maderas,"The aroma is rather flat and charred, but the cup is sweetly roasty with some nut and cleanly bracing burned tones, together with a sweetly tart fruit -- orange perhaps, or ripe pineapple.",, Aug 2004
87.0,Nicaraguan Organic Fair Trade,"Intensely sweet, round fruit swoons toward milk chocolate in the aroma. Simplifies in the cup, the aromatics dominated by an intense acidity that is properly sweet but -- perhaps owing to its sheer intensity -- lacks an impression of depth and fruit.",, Aug 2004
87.0,Nicaragua El Rosario (Cup of Excellence),"High-toned fruit - pineapple or tamarind - in the aroma. In the cup medium bodied and mid-toned, with refined, sweetly smooth acidity and subtle, subdued notes of nut, orange and tamarind.",, Aug 2004
88.0,Organic/Fair Trade Nicaragua,"Delicately pungent, richly balanced aroma with excellent dimension and tickles of pear and chocolate. Comfortable in the cup, balanced, with an almost sugary sweetness. Caramel and chocolate undercurrents, but basically a coffee that charms with quiet completeness rather than excites with complexity.",, Aug 2004
91.0,Nicaragua Matagalpa Organic Fair-Trade,"Lovely, lyric coffee. Distinct apricot and milk chocolate notes in the aroma. In the cup sweet, balanced, with a delicate acidity lifting on rich undercurrents of bittersweet chocolate and apricot-toned fruit. For such a lyric coffee the finish is surprisingly long and bracing.",, Aug 2004
94.0,Nicaragua Maragogipe Organic,"Complexly fruity and richly floral coffee - papaya, lemon, coffee fruit, hints of dusk-blooming flowers and chocolate, all ride a strong, balanced structure: good body, smooth mouthfeel, supple, sweet acidity.",, Aug 2004
83.0,India Monsooned Malabar,"Dense, heavy aroma: fresh-cut pine, Mediterranean herbs, with an elusive hint of fruit - pear perhaps. In the cup an unusually heavy, rather gritty body, bitter walnut tones and distinct pine and resiny herb notes - rosemary perhaps.",, Jul 2004
85.0,Monsoon Malabar,"In the aroma sweet and pungent with aromatic wood notes and a whiff of fermented fruit. In the cup nutty and sweet; the fermented fruit tones intensify as the cup cools, landing in a potentially intriguing spot somewhere between chocolate and composted apricot.",, Jul 2004
86.0,India Monsooned Malabar,"Aromatic woods and a hint of sweetly fermented fruit in the aroma. Very sweet in the cup, with rich walnut notes and a continued hint of fermented fruit inclining toward chocolate - think of overripe apricots rolled in chocolate sprinkles.",, Jul 2004
87.0,Mysore Mystic,"In the aroma sweetly pungent, rich but delicate, complicated by low-toned fruit suggesting ripe apricots. The lovely aromatics are slightly less impressive in the cup, where they are dominated by a sharp bittersweetness. Slightly astringent in the finish.",, Jul 2004
87.0,India Monsooned Malabar,"Densely but sweetly and gently pungent in the aroma. Richly low-key, heavy-bodied, with gently charred cedar notes. Just sweet and complex enough to escape inertia.",, Jul 2004
87.0,Monsoon Mist,"The aroma is sweetly and gently pungent with spice and dried apricot. In the cup very sweet, smooth in mouthfeel, with a quietly complex, raisin-toned fruit that manages to suggest a sort of wine-toned chocolate.",, Jul 2004
88.0,Indian Mysore,"Sweet, midtoned, and intensely fragrant with an odd but pleasingly complex of sweet citrus (orange and Meyer lemon?) and fresh-cut cedar. This striking aromatic combination hints at a sort of herb-toned chocolate toward the rich but slightly heavy, bittersweet finish.",, Jul 2004
89.0,India Jumboor Estate Plantation A,"Sweet and fruity in the aroma with raisin and chocolate complication. In the cup delicate in mouthfeel, tartly sweet, and richly and roundly fruity. Cleanly sweet and rich in the short finish, though a slight but not unpleasurable astringency lingers in the long.",, Jul 2004
92.0,India Mysore Nuggets,"Luxuriously sweet, delicately pungent, with tart but lush tropical fruit notes, tamarind perhaps, running through the profile from aroma to finish. The tamarind fruit notes incline toward a richly raisin-toned chocolate in the long finish.",, Jul 2004
90.0,Indian Mysore Nuggets,Very sweet aroma with fresh peach and chocolate mid tones and balancing cedar bottom notes. Delicate in the cup with a gently tart acidity wrapped in a rather giddy sweetness. The fruit notes are cleanly wine-like.,, Jul 2004
92.0,Espresso Ticino,"The aroma is elegantly simple: toasty and sweet with low-key fruit notes suggesting ripe apricot. Superb in the small cup: velvety mouthfeel, substantial body, deep-toned but crisply dry chocolate and apricot notes, with a long, clean, sweet finish. Solid, chocolaty presence in milk, but the glory here is in the classic but powerful straight shot.",, Jun 2004
84.0,Hi-Octane,"Charred aroma, lean mouthfeel and a bitterish sharpness in the small cup all suggest an overly aggressive roast. But a floral sweetness wafts through the profile and contributes to a fine presence in milk: still a bit lean in mouthfeel but alive with leather, apricot and chocolate notes.",, Jun 2004
87.0,Sexpresso,"Crisp cedar tones and sweet chocolate in the small cup. In milk the chocolate further blooms and softens, and the cedar tones read as a high-toned sweetly tart fruit (pineapple?).",, Jun 2004
88.0,Espresso Dolce,"Subdued but gently elegant aroma. Stiffens a bit in the cup, landing somewhere between crisp and sharp, but with a gentle undercurrent of chocolate sweetness. The fruit and chocolate stop just short of richness in milk.",, Jun 2004
88.0,Espresso Abruzzo,"The aroma is sweet, smoky and toasty. In the small cup the smoky tones complement a dry but lush fruitiness. Comes richly into its own in milk, where the smoke and toast tones read as fresh leather and the dry fruit turns crisply chocolate.",, Jun 2004
88.0,Espresso,"Bittersweet in the small cup, with little nuance or complexity but impressive weight and a buttery presence. The big body carries into milk with predictable power, the simple bittersweetness blooming into an expansively sweet, prune-toned chocolate.",, Jun 2004
89.0,Espresso,"An unusually successful ultra-dark-roasted espresso: the gently burned tones in the aroma develop rather than dominate the pronounced dry fruit and chocolate notes that carry from aroma through small cup into milk, where they bloom with lean but masterful authority.",, Jun 2004
89.0,Espresso del Norte,"Big but elegantly leathery aroma laced with chocolate. In the small cup a dry sharpness limits the chocolate tones, but they reassert themselves in milk, blossoming richly with a long, hazelnut-toned finish.",, Jun 2004
90.0,Platinum Blond Espresso,"The Gimme!Coffee package describes this blend's aroma as ""Centennial Harley leather."" I can-t say much about Centennial or Harley, but I'd agree on the leather, with maybe a kinky smear of chocolate thrown in. Flavor is described as ""Dive Bar Chic."" As a dive bar innocent I'd call it dense, simple, but big and balanced, with more leather and perhaps some pleasantly pungent cedar notes. No leather makes it into the milk, but a very pleasant, high-toned chocolate-and-nuts sweetness does.",, Jun 2004
90.0,Vito’s Espresso Blend,"Richly and elegantly roasty and bittersweet in aroma and small cup with high-toned, pear-like fruit shimmering at the top. The finish is heavy and slightly bitter, a liability in the small cup but an advantage in milk, where the dairy turns the cup deeply yet lyrically sweet with a whole candy-counterful of sophisticated chocolate tones.",, Jun 2004
90.0,Ruby’s Organic Espresso,"Superb single-shot espresso distinguished by its fruit tones and general resonant depth of sensation.  The aroma is robustly fruity and sweet, the small cup roundly and sweetly roasty with toast and chocolate notes. Simplifies slightly in milk but still agreeably expresses a high-toned, fruity chocolate.",, Jun 2004
91.0,Fellowship of the Bean Organic Espresso,Fresh cut cedar and fruit. The fruit richly and sweetly dominates in the aroma. In the small cup the cedar complicates and gives a resiny authority to the fruit. The fruit and cedar turn to an intriguingly pungent chocolate in milk.,, Jun 2004
93.0,Espresso Classico,"Serenely balanced yet powerfully complete. Low-key, roundly rich in the small cup, with dry fruit and bittersweet chocolate notes. Masters milk with crisp, quiet assurance: fresh leather, milk chocolate, dry fruit.",, Jun 2004
93.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"Sweetly lyric with delicate but lushly complex high notes in the aroma. The softly lyric character carries into the cup, where the indeterminate aromatic complexity gives way to dramatic floral high notes and Meyer lemon and chocolate midtones.",, May 2004
77.0,Sumatra,"The aroma is intense but narrow in range and lacking nuance. In the cup definitively flat, with a flavor-dampening mustiness that reads as dull mildew rather than rich earth. Brightened only by a faintly woody sweetness and the barest hint of acidity. Nominated anonymously.",, May 2004
78.0,Breakfast Blend,"A thoroughly dispirited coffee, with little sweetness and limited nuance aside from hints of nondescript fruit and a sort of vegetal, slightly charred cocoa. This particular sample appears to consist of green coffees of ordinary to poor quality that were poorly roasted to boot. Presumably nominating reader C. Dowling got luckier than I did when he was inspired to nominate this blend as a ""mellow ... all-around coffee.""",, May 2004
79.0,Original Blend,"This particular sample of Original Blend exhibited an almost academically thorough anthology of coffee taints and shadow defects. Some cups were flat and musty, others seemed additionally green and astringent, and some were rich with a rather pleasant apricot-toned sweet ferment (perhaps what nominating reader Des Cabigan cited as ""a sniff of oranges""). But not a single cup appeared on the table without some taint or other. Presumably the several nominating readers based their emails on a better iteration of the Original Blend than this one, something closer to the version to which I gave an 87 rating in 2002.",, May 2004
81.0,Kaffe Moose Drool,"Intensely roasty; no rubber tones but overwhelmingly charred. Rather light-bodied but dense in sensation. The burned notes carry resiny hints of charred pine and pungent Mediterranean herbs; rosemary perhaps. Reader P. Teel found this coffee ""deep, rich and flavorful.""",, May 2004
81.0,Verona,"Decent enough in the aroma: sweetly pungent, balanced, intensely roasty with a twist of slightly charred cedar. In the cup sweet and pungent, but the charred cedar notes turn to charred board notes, expressionless and woody. A vague hint of fruit at the top of the profile. I hope the nominating reader tasted a better sample of the Verona than this one.",, May 2004
85.0,Traditional Roast,"In the aroma this light-to-medium-roasted coffee is sweet, high-toned but round, with a whiff of lightly fermented fruit that suggests brandied chocolate. In the cup the agreeably rich, overripe fruit is complemented - or contradicted - by a sweet-toned but blunt acidity. The finish is long and rather heavily astringent. Several readers nominated Gevalia coffees, including this blend.",, May 2004
85.0,Plantation Blend,"Complex aroma: sweet chocolate, some shimmers of flowers and spicy cedar. For me the cup was contradictory rather than balanced, its sweet chocolate tones uneasily cohabiting with a sharp acidity: think sweet-and-sour chocolate. Nominating reader Woodard Springstube reports that ""Plantation Blend is a long-time favorite of mine, although I like all of Community's blends.""",, May 2004
86.0,Cafe Blend,"Rich, sweet aroma with distinct caramel tones in the finish. Gently lively in the cup, with caramel, cocoa, and temperate fruit notes - I'd call them apple. A low-key cup, just spirited enough to avoid laziness. Several readers nominated Dunkin' Donuts coffees.",, May 2004
87.0,African Classic,"Low-key, bittersweet and roasty in the aroma with suggestions of apple and charred cedar. In the cup sweet floral top notes float almost irrelevantly over the rather densely monotoned, pungently dark-roast heart. The cup softens and sweetens as it cools, however, allowing the floral notes to bloom in pleasant counterpoint to the pungency.",, May 2004
87.0,Organic Shade-Grown Sumatra,"Deep, resonant aroma, gently pungent, complicated by ripe cherry and fresh leather. In the cup settles into a classic traditionally processed Sumatra cup: musty earth tones and tart fruit notes, tamarind and dry cherry perhaps. Reader Pat Teel nominated another Hunter Bay coffee (Kaffe Moose Drool); we received this one as a bonus.",, May 2004
87.0,Guatemala Antigua,"Simple aroma, bittersweet without much complication - a shimmer of fruit perhaps. In the cup turns from simple to gently classic: sweet, nutlike, temperate fruit notes reading as milk chocolate. Nominated by Deborah Ciangura of Wilmington, North Carolina.",, May 2004
88.0,Guatemala Atitlan,"Superbly complex aroma; elegantly fruity: ripe apricot, cherry, cedar, fresh leather. Slightly imbalanced in the cup by an intense acidity only partly buffered by sweetness, but recovers itself in a long, rich finish. Anonymously nominated.",, May 2004
88.0,Colombian Vintage La Cacica,"A gently austere cup: balanced, lightly acidy, crisply and quietly complex: dried apricot, bittersweet chocolate, perhaps a twist of fresh-cut cedar. Softens and sweetens engagingly as it cools. Reader Maria Rueda from Washington, D.C. finds ""It's the best coffee I've every tried!""",, May 2004
88.0,Rainforest Blend,"A lush, complex cup that derives some of its considerable appeal from slightly fermented fruit tones: apricot in the aroma, apple and pear in the cup, all turned overripe and slightly chocolate-leaning by the ferment. Some cups were gloriously sweet and juicily fruity; others slightly bitter in the finish. Marcus Fitzsimmons nominated this coffee, adding a general plug for Caribou Coffee: ""Awesome selection of various coffees including a welcoming store-side atmosphere.""",, May 2004
88.0,Costa Rica,"Sweet, rich, and gently roasty in the aroma. Think caramel and toast. The range of sensation narrows slightly in the cup but remains delicately bracing with crisp dry fruit and cedar notes. Anonymously nominated.",, May 2004
90.0,Windsor Court Blend,"Crisply rich in the aroma, with sweet apple-toned high notes. In the cup simple and engaging as an early Beatles song, with an acidity felt rather than tasted and seductively fruity milk chocolate notes. W. Morris Brown Jr. nominated this coffee with a simple tribute: ""I like it.""",, May 2004
92.0,Kona Extra Fancy,"Sweetly melodic, soft but substantial, with a gentle tickle of acidity. A spice-toned chocolate complicates the aroma and resurfaces in a long, easy finish. Nominating reader Monique Tam calls this ""The best 100% Kona I have tasted."" It certainly was the best of the four Konas I sampled for this month's cupping.",, May 2004
90.0,"Nicaragua Organic, El Jaguar","Deep and balanced, smooth in mouthfeel, low in acidity, rich with sweet wine- and chocolate-cherry-toned fruit and a resiny hint of cedar. Nominating reader John Outler applies the technical tasting term ""Yummy!"" to this coffee before continuing ""Perfect intersection between dark and light [roast]. Not too bitter.""",, May 2004
95.0,"Kenya AA, 2003 Crop","An enormous, enveloping coffee, grandly acidy yet voluptuously sweet. So sweet the term acidy becomes almost moot, though its dry rigor necessarily grounds and complicates the sweetness. Cabernet wine and ripe cherry notes. Anonymously nominated.",, May 2004
92.0,Colombian Supremo Popayan,"A classic high-grown Latin-American profile: Cherry- and grape-toned fruit in the sweet, high-toned aroma. In the cup big and smooth-bodied, rich, sweetly but intensely acidy, with an essence-of-coffee fruit that edges toward chocolate.",, Apr 2004
80.0,Kahve Barcelona Blend,In the aroma sweetly and cleanly roasty and cedar-toned. The roasty tones turn burned and rather cloyingly sweet in the cup - lightly charred cedar or sandalwood.,, Apr 2004
81.0,French Roast,"Predictable ultra-dark roast: intense and pungent with an edge of charred cedar in the aroma; in the cup thin in mouthfeel and sweetly charred, with a mildly astringent finish that lovers of this style of roast will find bracing.",, Apr 2004
82.0,Roy’s Blend,"The cup gives an impression of both thinness and richness. Overripe fruit - peaches perhaps - settle toward an agreeable but pungent chocolate. Two cups of five were bitter, suggesting that the pleasant intrigue of overripe-fruit-cum-chocolate was induced by a slightly fermented component to the blend.",, Apr 2004
83.0,Wolfgang Puck Reserve,"Impressive aroma: lush, low-toned apricot fruit. In the cup a full body with a nice heft in the mouthfeel, but the pungent fruit turns increasingly salty and bitter as the cup cools.",, Apr 2004
85.0,French Market Special Blend,"The chicory in this moderately dark-roasted blend announces itself tactfully but distinctly in the peppery mouthfeel, spicy, resiny notes (think rosemary stored in a scorched cedar box), with a hint of round, slightly, salty fruit underneath - Chinese salt plums perhaps.",, Apr 2004
86.0,Caffe Luna,"Roasty and sweetly and gently charred, with a hint of fermented fruit that under the influence of the roast suggests a spicily aromatic chocolate - imagine bittersweet chocolate stored in charred cedar. Rich finish with a tingle of astringency.",, Apr 2004
87.0,French Roast “Brazilian Blend”,"Impressively complex ultra-dark roast: The roast tones are sweet and rather restrained in the aroma, complicated by fresh leather and apricot. In the cup they turn rich, full-throated and bittersweet. The finish is a touch heavy and astringent, inevitable in a roast this dark.",, Apr 2004
88.0,Trotter’s Blend,"Balanced and roundly high-toned. Slightly roasty, gently acidy. Papaya and fresh leather notes in the aroma; papaya and dark chocolate in the cup. A tickle of astringency in the long finish.",, Apr 2004
88.0,Spring Blend,"Elegant, balanced dark roast: Comfortably sweet with a shimmer of acidity and a hint of roastiness. The bittersweet chocolate and pineapple notes in the aroma deepen and round congenially in the cup.",, Apr 2004
88.0,Vienna Roast,"Rather simple aroma but fine, deep, roasty dimension with distinct dark chocolate notes. In the cup roundly roasty with a tickle of acidity and chocolate and prune-toned fruit. A touch sharp when hot but softens and sweetens as it cools.",, Apr 2004
88.0,Medium Roast/Grind,"Sweet, balanced, round, with a hint of roastiness and a subtle, shifting bouquet of flowers, fresh leather, spice and apricot that deepen toward chocolate in the cup. As the cup cools it simplifies slightly, turning the fruit a touch shallow and tart.",, Apr 2004
88.0,40 Sardines Blend,"The aroma is roasty and quite sweet, with high-toned cedar and chocolate notes. Round and full in the cup, with a buttery mouthfeel and a balance of gentle roast tones and a tickle of sweet, fruit-toned acidity.",, Apr 2004
88.0,Kona Fancy Medium-Dark,"Delicately rich, with a shimmer of flowers in the aroma, pear deepening toward cherry and chocolate in the cup. Sweet, softly complex finish. The sample I cupped probably was delivered slightly stale from the restaurant; a fresh sample of the same coffee might well merit a higher rating.",, Apr 2004
90.0,Deluxe House Blend,"An understated coffee that rewards attention to its gentle virtues. Sweetly balanced roastiness and rich papaya-toned fruit in the aroma; in the cup delicately complex and quietly lush with low-toned, carnal fruit: apricot and papaya.",, Apr 2004
94.0,Kenya AA,"Simultaneously intensely acidy and extravagantly sweet, medium-bodied, with a whole basket of fruit tones: apricot, dry cherry, sweet lemon, a tiny whiff of chocolate, all lush, crisply rich, complex.",, Apr 2004
92.0,El Salvador,"Voluptuously classic coffee, perfectly poised between an almost sugary sweetness and a crisp, rich acidity. The mouthfeel is big and silky. The basic package is so complete that the hint of cherry- and tamarind-toned fruit comes as a bonus.",, Mar 2004
90.0,Organic Papua New Guinea,A cup that will put off purist coffee professionals but please everyone else: Fermented fruit tones that require some imagination to read as cherryish chocolate in the aroma simply explode with extravagantly complex fruit and floral nuance in the cup. As the cup cools the fruit seems to shed its ambiguous ferment entirely and turn cleanly lush.,, Mar 2004
81.0,Organic Andes Gold Peru,"Sweet, richly low-toned, luxuriously fruity, but distinctly musty. The mustiness is the almost effervescent kind that can be charitably read as spice. Cleans up a bit in a long, rather satisfying finish.",, Mar 2004
85.0,Peru Organic,"In the nose distinctly roasty, pungent, but quite sweet and resonantly round-toned. In the cup cleanly burned but still quite sweet, light-bodied but round in impression. Some fruit, perhaps softened by a hint of clean ferment, makes itself felt as the cup cools.",, Mar 2004
85.0,Organic Peru “La Florida”,"Rich in the aroma, pungent fruit, fresh leather, roasty chocolate. The roast tones turn the cup rather sharp and monotoned, however. In the finish softens once again toward a richly dry, chocolate-toned fruit.",, Mar 2004
85.0,Organic Peruvian Rainforest,"In the nose sweetly pungent, with a round, full, balanced roastiness free of burned tones. The roasty tones sharpen in the cup, however, carrying into a long but rather astringent finish.",, Mar 2004
86.0,Café Inkaico del Peru,"The aroma is subtly rich and crisp with dry cocoa tones. In the cup a sweetly balanced, delicately floral, cherry-toned coffee wants to emerge, but something is shadowing the profile, perhaps a very slight but flavor-dampening mildew.",, Mar 2004
88.0,"Rwanda A, Karaba Iakaka","Very sweet and round in both nose and cup, nuanced by a voluptuous fruity chocolate. This low-toned fruit may reveal a slight ferment that most palates will read as a complicating note to the chocolate.",, Mar 2004
90.0,"Rwanda A, Gikongoro Bufcafe","Superb aroma: sweet, balanced, intense, with deep dimension and a grand range of nuance, ranging from floral top notes to mid-tones of papaya and perhaps pear. In the cup an explosive entry, with intense, almost contradictory impressions of sweetness, bitterness, acidity and distinct floral and cherry-toned fruit. This amazing cup hardens a bit toward the finish, although the finish itself is smoothly rich and floral.",, Mar 2004
88.0,Peruvian Fair-Trade Organic,"In the nose intensely roasty and intensely alive with pungently sweet fruit - passion fruit, or sweet grapefruit. In the cup the powerful coupling of sweet fruit and bitterish roast tones persists. Patient palates may read a raisin-toned dark chocolate in the roasty fruit.",, Mar 2004
88.0,Ecuador Fair-Trade Organic,"A vastly rich, balanced medium-dark roast, distinctly nuanced from nose to finish with a deep, bittersweet, raisin-toned chocolate. As is often the case with deeply fruit-toned coffees, some of the lush richness may derive from a fortuitous edge of sweet ferment.",, Mar 2004
89.0,Bolivia Organic,"Lovely balance of sweet and dryly acidy tones; more than balanced, integrated and smoothly compete in expression. Floral notes in the nose; in the cup the cherry-toned fruit carries pleasing hints of a clean, sweet ferment.",, Mar 2004
81.0,Caffe Portofino,"Lots of complaints and caveats here. For Willem the aroma was ""slightly musty, chocolaty,"" for Ken ""heavy, bittersweet."" In the demitasse Willem found ""bitter, sharp flavor notes"" and Ken ""sharpish, ponderously sour tones"" although he did detect ""some incongruous floral topnotes."" ""Definitely lacked sweetness with and without milk,"" Willem concluded. (80) ""Powerful but oddly sourish in milk"" for Ken. (81)",, Feb 2004
82.0,Northwest Espresso,"Ken found this espresso matched its name: A straightforwardly roasty, simple espresso of the kind pumped out of roadside espresso carts and kiosks all over the Northwest: ""Dark-roasted with a smoky bite and a low-toned papaya-like fruit that turns vaguely chocolate in the finish. Smoky and a little flat in milk."" (84) Willem, however, acknowledges only the negative side of the aggressive roast with its limited range: ""Burned, dull aroma with unpleasant carbony and cardboard flavor."" (78)",, Feb 2004
82.0,El Presidente Organic Espresso,"Neither Ken nor Willem developed much enthusiasm for this beautifully packaged coffee. Willem apparently liked the ""mild floral notes"" in the aroma, but in the cup found both body and flavor ""lacked balance and temperature stability,"" meaning they changed for the worse as the coffee cooled. (82) Ken found the smoky, low-toned fruity aroma attractive, but the cup bitterly pungent and smoky without resonance or resilience. The coffee failed to ""blossom"" for him in milk and remained smoky and flat. (82)",, Feb 2004
84.0,Perugia Blend,"This well-known blend, which attracted high ratings in previous Coffee Review tastings, mildly disappointed in this incarnation (Willem 84, Ken 84). Aroma fared well enough. For Willem it was ""elegant, complex[ly] floral,"" for Ken ""sweet, rich, with papaya and perhaps mint."" Both found the small cup imbalanced, however. Willem described it as ""acidy [and] spicy,"" Ken as ""heavily pungent with aromatic wood notes."" This imbalance predictably softened in milk: ""Much better with milk than without"" Willem concluded, although Ken felt the presence in milk was substantial but ""rather ponderous with a woody finish.""",, Feb 2004
84.0,Espresso Blend,"Willem found this sample of the Starbucks staple blend ""balanced throughout with no major high [positive] or low [negative] notes in aroma, flavor and aftertaste. [In the demitasse] some sweetness with a bitter end note. With milk, sweet, spicy, [with] a mild, pungent aftertaste."" (85) Ken was less impressed. For him the aroma was ""smoky, sweet and subdued,"" the body lean, the small cup ""smoky and simple."" He was most taken with this ubiquitous blend's impact in milk: ""sweetens and rounds, prune fruit softens toward chocolate in the finish."" (83)",, Feb 2004
85.0,Trieste,"Ken admired this blend (86) more than Willem (83), who was ambivalent about the aroma (""chocolate with a hint of tobacco""), critical of the small cup (""lacks sweetness and balance"") though mildly approving of performance in milk (""pleasant caramel aftertaste""). For Ken, the aroma also was a bit feeble and musty in its chocolate and papaya suggestions, the cup a bit too dominated by musty and slightly fermented fruit notes, but he felt the finish ""smoothed out nicely toward dry prune and chocolate,"" and the blend showed excellent presence in milk. He got so carried away he decided he found marzipan and mint notes in the milk finish.",, Feb 2004
85.0,Parioli,"Both Ken and Willem admired the aroma of this rather darkly roasted blend, but the ambiguous flavor notes in the cup provoked ambivalence. For Willem the aroma was ""excellent & fine and deep at the same time, with delicious floral notes,"" for Ken it was ""sweet with a round, roasty chocolate and peach and floral notes."" In the cup Willem found  an ""interesting flavor with an overpowering berry, almost musty, fruit aftertaste"" (86) and Ken ""dominating pungent, smoky tones, with a dry edge of chocolate; rather sharp and thin in the finish."" (83)",, Feb 2004
85.0,Hair Bender Espresso,"Ken and Willem were eight points apart on this one. Ken liked the aromatic excitement of the ""floral and fruit notes with complex smoky undertones"" that he followed with pleasure from aroma through finish to milk. Although he found the small cup a bit sharp and thin-bodied, he forgave all in return for the floral and fruit complexity. (89) Willem, on the other hand, tasted nothing but imbalance and too much acidity: ""Somewhat dull aroma with minor earthy notes"" and in the small cup ""mildly sharp and some uncontrolled acidity."" He was a bit more forgiving with performance in milk: ""sweet, bright, with caramel aftertaste."" (81)",Price: NA, Feb 2004
87.0,Espresso Roast,"Both Willem and Ken found this blend satisfying, though not exciting. Willem: ""elegant floral aroma. Overall: smooth and soft with pleasantly lingering aftertaste. Rich caramel notes in milk."" (87) Ken: ""Complex in a narrow range: smoky, sweet fruit in the aroma, smoky and spicy in the demitasse. Caramelly and sweet though a bit shallow in milk."" (86)",, Feb 2004
89.0,Espresso Vita,"For Ken this naturally low-acid, lighter roasted blend was ""Sweetly musty, cherry and apple in the aroma, heavy body with a tingle in the mouthfeel, crisp and toasty rather than sharp in the small cup, with excellent dimension and range.""(91) Willem was less excited: ""Bubbly and rich body. Chocolate, caramel notes with mildly woody then fruit notes in the aftertaste."" (87) For both Ken and Willem, this blend came most distinctly into its own in milk. ""Wonderful mastery of milk"" according to Ken, ""rich, complete, with a sort of carnal, earth-toned fruity chocolate."" Willem: ""Fantastic with milk: sweet, rich, lingering chocolate.""",, Feb 2004
90.0,Espresso Paladino,"Willem: ""Blossom-like, peppery aroma, just like the roses from my 50+year-old rose tree! Mild sweet flavor with lingering floral aftertaste. Excellent caramel complexity with milk. I loved it."" (92) What for Willem was peppery and blossom-like, for Ken was spicy and fruity in the aroma and smokily fruity in the small cup. Ken wanted more sweetness in the demitasse but in milk praised this blend as ""sweet, crisp and cherry-like edging toward chocolate."" (89).",, Feb 2004
90.0,Caffe del Sol,"Both Ken and Willem liked this blend, but Willem really liked it: ""Floral aroma, buttery, smooth body, sweet flavor with berry and prune notes. Lingering aftertaste with resonant sweetness. Fantastic and complete as milk drink, with chocolate and caramel notes."" (93) Ken honored and enjoyed the fruit notes, which he found complex but rather tart once past the aroma (""tart berry and pineapple, dry chocolate"" in the small cup, ""tart fruit with a floral finish"" in milk). In the end Ken found the cup just a bit short on sweetness and depth of sensation, both with milk and without  (87).",, Feb 2004

82.0,Sumatra Organic,"When hot, a robust, full-bodied dark roast with a pleasantly rough character: chocolate and wine tones in the aroma, in the cup a hint of fruity ferment and musty earth. As the coffee cools, however, the musty earth tones turn bitter and weigh oppressively on the cup.",, Feb 2004

85.0,Guatemala Antigua Finca El Valle,"Impressive aroma: balanced, sweetly acidy yet gently roasty, with suggestions of chocolate and low-toned fruit - papaya or apricot.

90.0,Serena Organic Blend,"A delicate cup with impressive complexity: Lemon, smoky spice and milk chocolate notes carry with subtle variation from aroma through finish. In the cup, shows a fine balance of sweet acidity and a subtle roastiness, the roast making itself felt mainly in the smoky spice. The five cups I sampled displayed some unevenness; otherwise I would rate this silky, aromatic blend even higher.",, Feb 2004

79.0,A Cafe Kind of Day Colombian (pod),"The aroma is woody with faint lemon and chocolate suggestions. The body is substantial, the cup round in mouthfeel with a low-toned acidity complicated by a vague dry fruit, more like prune pits than prunes. Further flattens and turns astringent as the cup cools.",, Jan 2004

86.0,Nakatosh Special Dark Roast,"The sweet musty tones that run from aroma into cup read as distinctly nut-like -- walnuts perhaps -- with an edge of low-toned fruit: pumpkin and papaya. All of that detail fades in the finish, which is long, lush, and sweetly clean.",, Dec 2003

85.0,Guatemalan Finca Dos Marias,"The cup is dominated by a simple, rich acidity.

87.0,Organic Fair Trade Huehuetenango,"When hot, complexly and giddily floral and fruity - caramel in the aroma, suggestions of lilac and violet, papaya and cantaloupe in the cup.

But try it; no one drinks coffee cold anyhow except coffee reviewers.",, Sep 2003

80.0,Rey Espresso,"Both Ken and co-taster Willem Boot criticized this coffee's tendency to sharpness and astringency. Ken nevertheless admired a ""heavy apricot-toned fruit"" that complicated the small cup and maintained a pleasing if lean presence in milk. Willem 76, Ken 84.",, Aug 2003
81.0,Astro Cafe,"Both Ken and co-taster Willem Boot found the aroma impressive: ""elegant, sweet nut"" for Willem, ""elegant, sweet and fruity"" for Ken. Once to the cup, however, neither found much to praise. Willem found the flavor ""pungent but sweet and sour,"" Ken ""bittersweet but sharp and shallow.""

82.0,Classic Espresso,"Both Ken and co-taster Willem Boot remarked on the vanilla- and floral-toned aroma. Once to the cup, however, neither was impressed. For Willem ""chocolate-bitter flavor and aftertaste"" in the small cup and ""spicy and slightly oniony in milk.""

85.0,Papua New Guinea,"This smoky, dark-roasted coffee pleased Ken and co-taster Willem Boot more in flavor than in body. Aromatics and flavor were ""smoky, rich and sweet"" (Ken), ""dark chocolate and smoky"" (Willem). Ken found the body ""gritty,"" however, Willem ""oily and heavy."" The cup softened but didn't sweeten in milk, where it was ""smoky and dry"" for Ken with a ""butterscotch finish"" for Willem. Willem 85, Ken 85.",, Aug 2003

Willem rating 87, Ken 87.",, Aug 2003
86.0,Panamanian,"A rather dramatic difference surfaced between co-taster Willem Boot and Ken on this very dark-roasted Panama. Ken wanted more sweetness and body; Willem apparently found enough of both and admired the elegant nuance. Willem: ""Aroma with caramel and mild-apricot notes. Despite the dark roast, balanced flavor with apricot and chocolate. Pleasantly spicy with milk"" (91). Ken: ""Lovely aroma, high-toned but sweet fruit notes. In the small cup lean-bodied and crisply bitter, with a rich but astringent finish. Fruit re-emerges in milk, dry, smoky, chocolate-toned."" (83).",, Aug 2003
88.0,Colombian,"A coffee in which a mild processing taint - sweet fermented fruit for Ken, a hint of mustiness for co-taster Willem Boot - turns toward chocolate under the influence of the dark roast.

Mild sweet and dry flavor balance with intense fruit and spicy notes. Cardamom flavor with milk."" Ken's admiration was more restrained.

84.0,El Salvador Pacamara,"The moderately dark roast takes on equal billing with the green coffee here. It preserves the essential sweetness of the coffee, but pushes the acidity toward a rich, pungent citrus, a sort of roasty grapefruit, if that can be imagined. The finish is mildly but bracingly astringent.",, Jul 2003
86.0,El Salvador,"A sweet, round coffee whose rich, low-key fruit notes suggest cantaloupe or apricot.

88.0,Organic El Salvador,"Attractive balance of chocolate-nuanced fruit, rich, low-toned  but emphatic acidity, and a hint of roastiness. Ultimately, however, remains contained in its own quiet balance. Lacks the tonal range and dimension that would lift it from satisfying to remarkable.",, Jul 2003

78.0,100% Colombian,"An example of what coffee professionals call a dirty or uneven coffee. At best nutty, midtoned, rather monotoned, without much bounce or resilience. At worst some cups displayed a rather unpleasant ferment while others were woody and cloyingly peanutty.",, Jun 2003
80.0,House Blend,"Either the green coffee was not up to the dark roast style, or the roast was conducted too aggressively: the roast dominates, producing a pungent and bitterly monotoned cup, with little to no nuance. The cup rounds and softens a bit as it cools, turning tenuously bittersweet.",, Jun 2003
82.0,House Blend,"Round, mild, sweet, with slightly fermented fruit notes that with imagination read as a sort of chocolaty peach or cherry. Turns slightly astringent in the finish.",, Jun 2003
82.0,Aroma Coffee,"Substantial body but shallow in dimension. Mid-toned, simple rather than plain, with clear vanilla-nut tones in the aroma and dry, prune-toned fruit with a tickle of dry herb in the cup.",, Jun 2003
84.0,Fair Trade Organic Sumatra,"This coffee provides about half the virtue of a great Sumatra: the full body and low-toned profile are here, but the vibrant dimension and complex nuance are missing. The cup is a bit monotoned and heavy rather than rich. Some bittersweet chocolate in the finish.",, Jun 2003
84.0,Royale Signature Blend,"Sweet, mid-toned, with a lively but unobtrusive acidity. Distinct vanilla notes in both aroma and cup and richly dry fruit notes, dried apricot or plum, in the cup. The finish is rich but rather astringent and heavy.",, Jun 2003
84.0,Soho Blend,"Balanced, mid-toned, gently roasty, with a hint of low-toned fruit. Agreeable, though rather inert.",, Jun 2003
85.0,India Monsooned Malabar,"A fine monsooned Malabar with the usual low acidity and heavy body of this exotic origin, but here, in a skillfully executed light-roast style, unusually sweet with complex nuance: low-toned cantaloupe-like fruit and a pungent, gingery mustiness that easily reads as nut, and, with imagination, as malty toned chocolate.",, Jun 2003
85.0,Hawaiian Kona Blend,"Apparently the blender who created this faux Kona aimed at a richly sweet, winy, roundly fruit-toned cup. He or she largely succeeded, though the success is marred by very mild but flavor-flattening mildew tones.",, Jun 2003
86.0,Chock Full O’ Nuts New York Classics 100% Colombian,"Lovely balanced, low-toned, bittersweet, richly understated cup. A slightly darker-than-supermarket-norm roast mellows the acidity nicely and nudges the fruit toward chocolate. The finish is a touch bitter.",, Jun 2003
87.0,"Kenya AA, Mirichu Estate, Dark Roast","A Kenya in the more delicate mode: dry yet sweet, crisply fruity with grapefruit, apricot and black currant notes. Turns from crisp to slightly astringent in the finish.",, Jun 2003
87.0,Guatemalan Antigua,"Seductively sweet, delicately balanced, high-toned. Meyer lemon notes when hot, chocolate and nut as the cup cools. Medium to light-bodied, but pleasingly silky in mouthfeel.",, Jun 2003
89.0,Vintage Colombian,"Aging apparently tamed the acidity and turned it low-key but vibrant. Rich, cherry and red-wine notes hint at chocolate with patient drinking. A shadow bitterness can be taken as either marring or balancing the opulence of the fruit.",, Jun 2003
87.0,Colombian Supremo Popayan,"What coffee people call acidity, the dry yet sweet sensation characteristic of high-grown coffees, is the main event here: rich, dominating, toned by black-cherry fruit with a slight cabernet-like twist.",, Jun 2003
89.0,Kenya Grand Cru,"Intense but sweet, fruit-toned acidity; delicate but rich in presence and mouthfeel. Lemon and grapefruit notes in the aroma; lemon and floral tones in the cup. The finish is lightly astringent but rich.",, Jun 2003
91.0,"Kenya Grand Cru, Store Roasted","A quintessential Kenya: sweetly and richly acidy, the cup complicated by the crisp, complex, dry fruit notes characteristic of Kenyas: grapefruit, black currant, black cherry. The finish is dryly tart but clean.",, Jun 2003
94.0,Fair Trade Organic Guatemala,"High-toned, sweet, light-footed and delicate, yet rich and deeply dimensioned. Lemon and red-wine notes in the aroma, in the cup red wine, cherry and a shimmer of flowers. Long, complex finish.",, Jun 2003
78.0,Ethiopian Harrar,"A wildly flawed but perversely interesting coffee. Dramatically uneven from cup to cup, with some cups dominated by a heavy and rather oppressive Mediterranean spice character (thyme or rosemary) and others displaying less oppressive and more pleasant floral and bitter fruit tones - in the latter case, imagine bitter-chocolate-covered jasmine petals. All of this aromatic peculiarity probably derives from a combination of mildly fermented fruit with a musty overlay acquired while the still fruit-encased beans were drying.",, May 2003
80.0,Cameroon Organic,"Very sweet and very, very musty. Somewhere behind the malty, musty/mildew tones a rich, cherry-toned coffee lurks.",, May 2003
83.0,Colombian Excelso,"Moderately acidy, medium to full bodied, sweet, rich, balanced, mid-toned. Not much nuance but a sturdy cup with a juicy tickle of cleanly fermented fruit. Marred by a rather bitter finish.",, May 2003
84.0,Peru Corona Royale,"A sweet, fruity Peru that suffers from musty, mildewed tones. The mild musty influence turns the fruit and floral notes pungent, dry, and bittersweet. Pleasantly so, aside from the rather heavy finish.",, May 2003
85.0,Jubilaum Blend,"Low-key, mild, balanced to a fault. Sweet, with the round richness of a good Viennese blend, but ultimately unexpressive and rather inert.",, May 2003
85.0,Gourmet Blend,"A low-toned but resonant, agreeable blend, crisp with tart, berry-toned fruit. Rather lean-bodied but rich in impression. The finish is sweet and balanced.",, May 2003
86.0,Yemen Arabian Mocca,"Medium-bodied, sweet, with the typical wild, slightly fermented Yemen fruit tones, in this case suggesting overripe cherry, apricot, and melon. In the finish the fruit ferment reads as a sort of brandied, bittersweet chocolate. A slight astringency in the finish suggests that during storage this coffee faded a bit, as Yemens quickly do.",, May 2003
87.0,Peruvian Tres Cumbres,"Delicate and soft, with a tart sweetness suggesting Meyer lemon. Supple, smooth, elegant.",, May 2003
90.0,Kenya AA,"The softer style of Kenya: sweet, flirty, utterly seductive, but with a gently acidy backbone. In the aroma crisp temperate fruit tones, apple or pear perhaps, in the cup flowers and chocolate.",, May 2003
91.0,King Hadramaut Blend,"A grandly acidy coffee, austerely tart yet voluptuously sweet. Complicated by hints of green apple or pie cherry, but the main expression is the huge, rich gesture of the acidity. The finish is tart but round and opulent.",, May 2003
93.0,Guatemala Antigua,"Medium bodied but delicate, soft, exquisitely balanced, giddy with sweet fruit tones that may suggest cherry but ultimately express the purity and elegance of a perfectly processed coffee. The finish is sweet, long, and gently rich.",, May 2003
81.0,Yauco Selecto,"Smoky and richly heavy in its aromatics, but rather musty and monotoned in the cup. The musty tones, as they often do in Sumatras, hint at positive associations like spice and a sort of rough chocolate, but ultimately are too hard and unresilient to sustain too positive a reading.",, Mar 2003
84.0,"Yauco Selecto AA, 2002-03 Crop","Rich but subdued, with a stealthy, understated sweetness. Some aromatic intrigue suggests apples and spice. The restrained aroma and rather flat finish compromises an otherwise roundly expansive Caribbean cup.",, Mar 2003
85.0,"Jamaican Blue Mountain, 2001-02 Crop","The full-bodied, quietly rich cup with its low-toned fruit and dusk floral notes is classic Blue Mountain. But the aromatics are a bit faded and the cup shadowed by a hint of mustiness, both of which suggest that this coffee is perhaps a bit past its prime.",, Mar 2003
87.0,"Jamaica Blue Mountain – Dark Roast, 2002-03 Crop","The roast turns the fruit high-toned and dryly pungent: cedar and spice in the aroma, sweet grapefruit in the cup. As the cup cools the fruit softens toward pear. Fine balance of sweet and dry tones in the cup, though the finish is rather heavily astringent.",, Mar 2003
87.0,Puerto Rico Clou du Mont,"Hugely rich, big-bodied, low-toned. Roundly full apricot and peach notes in both aroma and cup. A slight hint of mustiness shadows aroma and finish, but the cup is grandly clean.",, Mar 2003
87.0,"Jamaica Blue Mountain – Proprietor’s Choice, 2002-03 Crop","Full body and sweet, voluptuously rounded acidity. Low-toned, symphonically complex fruit suggests melon in aroma, spicy apricot in cup and finish. A slight hint of mustiness is coiled inside the richness, modestly lowering my rating of this otherwise classic Blue Mountain cup.",, Mar 2003
88.0,"Jamaica Blue Mountain, 2001-02 Crop","Not your purist's Blue Mountain, but a fine, complex cup: rich, wine-like fruit, jasmine notes, and a hint of pleasantly rough mustiness that reads as a spicy chocolate",, Mar 2003
89.0,"Old Tavern Estate, 2001-02 Crop","Medium-bodied but expansively rich with complex mid to low notes. Cedar, nuts and dry fruit in the aroma; sweetly melodic fruit and floral notes in the cup. A dash of astringency in the finish tightens the fruit notes toward grapefruit.",, Mar 2003
90.0,"Jamaica Blue Mountain, 2002-03 Crop","Delicate but rich. Medium body, sweet, round-toned acidity, and complex aromatics: In the aroma nut, floral, and cocoa-toned fruit, in the cup floral and spicy apple or pipe-tobacco notes. A cleanly balanced astringency enriches rather than flattens the finish.",, Mar 2003
86.0,Sanchez Gran Reserva Costa Rica,"Sweet, round, balanced, with a striking complex of aromatics that reads as wine or spicy fruit, figs perhaps. The finish is rich, winy, and slightly astringent.",, Feb 2003
86.0,Outerbanks Blend,"Sweetly and robustly roasty. Musty tones, probably from the Sulawesi, hover between a sort of spice and a pleasantly dry chocolate, contributing an edge of intrigue to the pleasant balance of roastiness and rounded acidity. Roastmaster Brandon Riggs cites this blend's ""tangy brightness and ... smooth body.""",, Feb 2003
88.0,Costa Rica,"The roast nicely develops the clean, classically simple Costa Rica profile, rounding the sweet but authoritative acidity and turning a hint of fruit tartly pineapple-toned. Torreo owner Eric Patrick finds ""floral [and] rich Burgundy"" notes in this versatile cup.",, Feb 2003
88.0,JR Reserve Blend,"The balanced dark roast is so tactful that even some acidity survives. Shimmering inside the dominant roastiness are tantalizing shimmers of flowers, a gentle, generalized fruit, and rounded citrus notes, grapefruit perhaps. A slight astringency in the long, rich finish reduced the rating for me, but other coffee drinkers may find this sensation bracing.",, Feb 2003
88.0,Galapagos,"A rich, low-key, satisfying cup dominated by an unusual complex of flavor notes associated with coffee from trees of the heirloom Bourbon variety. This is a dry fruit character that suggests wine at one moment, at another tart berries, at another pipe tobacco, at still another a roasty but sweet chocolate. Owner and green buyer Philip Anacker cites its ""gentle acidity and distinct flavors.""",, Feb 2003
89.0,Breakfast Blend,"Rich and dryly acidy with a deep, backgrounded sweetness. Mildly fermented wine tones turn maraschino cherry chocolate in the long, complex finish. The ferment tones contribute splendidly in this blend, which improves as it cools.",, Feb 2003
89.0,Kenya Thiriku,"Relatively light bodied but intensely dry and richly astringent, with an austere pineapple- and grapefruit-toned fruit. The finish, like the cup, is astringent but exhilarating. Director of Coffee Geoff Watts admires this Kenya's ""pristine character"" and its ""dynamic and elegant acidity.""",, Feb 2003
89.0,Nicaragua La Union,"Relatively light roasted but deep toned, with big body, rich, cabernet-like acidity, and a black-cherry fruit that saturates the profile from bottom notes to top. Timothy's Director of Coffee Bill Herne praises its ""complex flavor and sweet finish.""",, Feb 2003
90.0,Colombia La Vereda,"Powerfully but sweetly acidy, rich, with distinct red wine and cherry tones. Seductive but challenging.",, Feb 2003
90.0,New Crop Pacific Blend,"An almost impossibly sweet, smooth dark roast, cleanly roasty, without bitterness. Complex but almost subliminal hints of meaty fruit, apricot perhaps, with patience suggest chocolate.",, Feb 2003
90.0,Panama La Torcaza,"Intense but balanced acidity, medium body, and tartly sweet fruit notes --berry and citrus -- that soften toward chocolate in the finish. Director of Coffee Geoff Watts praises this coffee's ""grace and completeness.""",, Feb 2003
90.0,Kenya AA,"A sweet Kenya, seductive rather than severe with its balanced acidity and delicate, quietly complex citrus and floral tones.",, Feb 2003
91.0,Ethiopian,"Deeply, richly acidy, but without any edge unblunted by an enveloping, buffering sweetness. Surprisingly heavy body; a shimmering cocktail of pineapple, pear, citrus and floral notes in the nose.

91.0,"Papua New Guinea, Medium Dark","Exquisitely balanced cup. Delicately acidy and sweet with clean, high-toned fruit that nods gently at chocolate. Restrained yet complex; precious.

85.0,Saturday’s Blend,"Reader ""Siehata"" nominated a ""morning blend"" from Seattle's Best Coffee,testifying that SBC ""has been a favorite of mine for years. Better than Millstone or even theover-priced burnt Starbucks."" I couldn't find a Seattle's Best morning blend, so I pickedSaturday's Blend, figuring that Saturdays have mornings, maybe better mornings than the otherdays of the week. I found it crisply roasty (though most definitely not burned), with pleasantlydry, bittersweet chocolate tones. For me it hit the sweet spot of dark roasted coffees, butdisplayed a limited range of aromatics and a lean body. Perhaps it had sat in its bag too long.",, Jan 2003
87.0,Qualita Oro,"Reader ""Cynmar69"" reports this espresso blend ""has a true coffee taste, ...smooth and flavorsome unlike most burnt flavored coffees."" I found it full-bodied and fat on thetongue, with the kind of pleasantly fermented fruit tones that suggest chocolate-covered cherries.A shimmer of sharp acidity is balanced by sweetness. The finish is clean, rich and chocolaty.Slightly disappointing in small milk, where the coffee seems to simplify without softening, but inlarger milk the fruit and chocolate tones bloom nicely. The preground, canned format doubtlessaccounts for the subdued aroma.",, Jan 2003
87.0,Dark Roast (reviewed as espresso),"Reader Derick Miller called Graffeo to my attention, testifying that this groupof three small in-store roasters produces ""great coffee."" I brewed this dark-roasted version of theGraffeo blend as espresso and found it medium-bodied, smooth in mouthfeel, sweet but crisplyroasty. In small milk the bittersweetness read as a dry, smoky chocolate; in larger milk as adelicately sweet but rather dilute chocolate.",, Jan 2003
87.0,Sulawesi (Celebes) Medium Roast,"Reader Ben Anderson calls this coffee ""fantastic."" That familiar adjectivefreshens up when applied to Sulawesi coffees, whose unexpected forest and fruit notes often doseem to express a sort of adventurous coffee fantasy. When hot, this Sulawesi displayed a richcup with a fine balance of acidity, sweetness and roastiness plus - the Sulawesi factor - carnally rich fruit notes reminiscent of cantaloupe. I started with a rating of over 90, but as the cup cooleda slight salty astringency in the finish lowered my assessment.",, Jan 2003
87.0,Colombian Supremo,"A classic medium-roasted Latin-American cup, acidy but distinctly sweet andfree of bitterness. The acidity displays some pleasant complication: tangy, grapefruity, perhapsspicy. Nominating reader John Schulz of Northglenn, Colorado rates his sample 90 - 94, findingit ""rich and complex, with subtle winey notes."" I tasted no wine notes in the sample I broughthome, but wine - sweet fermented fruit - notes are quite common in contemporary Colombiacoffees and doubtless appear in other batches of the Millstone presentation.",, Jan 2003
87.0,Wiener Melange (as espresso),"Reader Liz Snyder of Newark, Ohio rates this blend 95 - 100 on the basis of an evaluation thatmakes up in enthusiasm for what it may lack in technical detail: ""I love [this coffee]. It tastes SOgood."" I evaluated the Wiener Melange as espresso. In the demitasse I found it full and round inbody and heavily bittersweet in flavor, complicated by dry chocolate tones. In small milk itremained dry, smoky, chocolaty and rather heavy. In larger milk it came fully into its own,softening but still dominating with fruit- and chocolate-nuanced authority.",, Jan 2003
89.0,Organic Espresso,"""Great crema - best espresso I've ever had,"" writes Mandy Elion of Pasadena,California, who rates Supreme Bean espressos 90 - 94. This all-organic espresso blend isbalanced, richly and roundly roasty in the demitasse, with undertones of fruity chocolate. Atingle of astringency in the finish is invigorating rather than rough. In small milk comes acrossheavy with fruity chocolate tones; in large milk sweetly and roundly fruity.",, Jan 2003
89.0,Weisheit Der Alter,"Reader Peter Lynagh nominated this coffee. I found it brightly acidy but richlysweet, with opulently high-toned lemon and orange notes. Simplifies a bit in the finish, leavingbehind a pucker of astringency.",, Jan 2003
90.0,Light Roast,"Reader Derick Miller called Graffeo to my attention, testifying that this groupof three small in-store roasters produces ""great coffee."" I found this light-roasted version of theGraffeo blend acidy but sweet, rich, with a broad flavor range including delicate orange and floralnotes. Both aroma and finish showed a slight bitter edge which rounded and softened as the cupcooled.",, Jan 2003
90.0,Espresso Raymundo,"Reader Jim Beckham of Athens, Texas reports he drinks ""about a pound a week ofthis espresso. I frequently try others, but I always come back to this great blend."" I might comeback to it too. Dry fruit, chocolate and leather notes, fat body, smooth, round, completelywithout bitterness. In milk excellent authority: rich, developing from dry chocolate in small dairyto milk chocolate in large.",, Jan 2003
91.0,Jamaican Blue Mountain Light Roast,"Reader Ben Anderson finds this Blue Mountain ""phenomenal,"" a ""yardstickexample of the variety ... extremely complex and proportioned."" Certainly a fine example of theBlue Mountain profile, far better than any production roast Blue Mountain I have cupped overthe past few years: balanced, with resonant, bell-toned dimension and classic fruit notes of pure essential coffee character.",, Jan 2003
84.0,Guatemala Antigua,"A big, simple, acidy coffee only partly tamed by the darkish roast. The result is a bit of a hybrid: medium-bodied, roasty but acidy, reasonably sweet, but with only a hint of Antigua-style nuance, some fruit perhaps. The finish is slightly astringent, always a danger when an acidy coffee is brought to a darkish roast. The nominating reader Carolina Facciani of Redondo Beach, California rates the Starbucks Guatemala she or he tasted a 95 to 100, declaring it ""one of the best tasting coffees I've had next to Costa Rica's coffees."" The big acidity and relative lack of nuance does make this coffee resemble high-grown Costa Ricas.",, Dec 2002
84.0,Dark Roast,"""Auburnbulldog"" gives this venerable grocery store coffee from Louisiana a 90 to 94 rating ""because for a non-specialty coffee it is by far the best. I cringe when I go from Community to Starbucks."" I found it a fine example of a (non-chicory) New Orleans-style blend: roundly low-acid coffees with a musty or mildewy edge (probably mainly Brazils) turned malty and rich by the moderately dark roast.",, Dec 2002
84.0,MJB 100% Colombian,"The reader who nominated this canned supermarket coffee describes it as ""not a harsh acid coffee. The taste comes through. Try it."" I did, and found it a good though not great medium-roasted Colombia coffee: robustly acidy with decent complementing sweetness, full-bodied, but with little complexity or nuance. I agree that the acidity is not ""harsh,"" but I did find it just a shade too overbearing and perhaps a touch sour.",, Dec 2002
86.0,Panama La Florentina,"The reader who nominated this coffee rated it an 85 -- 89, citing its ""great aroma and floral hints,"" and adding that it is ""a great breakfast coffee."" I'd agree, though the sample I cupped may have sat around in its elegant bag too long. It belongs to the authoritative rather than the delicate style of Panama: intensely acidy, yet still displaying the bright, high-toned sweet nut, floral and fruit notes characteristic of this underappreciated origin. I felt the profile suffered from bitterness, however, which turned the acidity a bit too assertive for many coffee drinkers.",, Dec 2002
87.0,Magnolia Blend,"This very dark-roasted blend teeters on the edge of burned, but backs off nicely to stay on the agreeably sweet side of bittersweet. Fruit and fruit-toned chocolate notes, a suggestion of flowers, with only a shadow astringency. The Seattle-based reader who nominated this blend describes it as his (or her) ""favorite local coffee. And as I am from Seattle, that's saying something.""",, Dec 2002
86.0,Organic House Blend,"For a coffee from northern California,  the home of ultimate and often bitter dark roasts, this one is quite delicate, subtly roasty but gently dry, unobtrusively sweet, with echoes of dry, high-toned fruit. ""I have been coming to this shop for 10 years now,"" the nominating reader writes, ""and they definitely have the best coffee in the world.""",, Dec 2002
87.0,Clasico del Otono,"Reader Peter Lynagh nominated this coffee, rating it a 90 to 94. He describes it as ""sweet, bold, fruit-toned, yet perfectly balanced and round,"" as well as ""paradoxical."" Paradoxical perhaps because it maintains the fruity brightness of medium-roasted coffees while avoiding aggressively dry or acidy notes. I would agree with all of the above, though I wish that my sample had not displayed a slight, muted bitterness.",, Dec 2002

89.0,Kenya AA,"Classic Kenya profile: Austerely dry and acidy, with a crisp, astringent-yet-sweet fruit note that coffee professionals are fond of describing as black current. If black current does not ring any synapses, try dried cherries. However described, this flavor note is exceptional in the world of coffee.  The discerning reader who nominated this coffee offered no description, but bravely rated it a 95 to 100.",, Dec 2002
90.0,Masai Blend,"A startlingly distinctive coffee: richly fruity with almost symphonic aromatics and pronounced but sweet acidity. ""Best blend in the world!"" exclaims the nominating reader. ""One of the few blends that has distinctive regional characteristics --  in this case a lighter roast highlights and protects a wonderfully lively flavor.""",, Dec 2002
94.0,Nicaraguan Maracaturra Light Roast,"Extraordinary, luxurious coffee, lushly sweet yet vibrantly acidy, with ripe, opulent fruit tones and delicately intense floral high notes. Utterly free of bitterness or astringency. Perfectly roasted, and as extravagantly complex as the very finest East Africa coffees. Nominator David Lubertozzi of Berkeley raves about its ""amazing body and milk-chocolateyness,"" and confesses he enjoys it even better cold than hot -- always a sign of an exceptional coffee.",, Dec 2002
83.0,"Organic Sumatra, Fair-Trade","Lindsey Bolger: ""A coffee with some interesting twists and turns. While dominated by a less desirable woody flavor, a sweet and chocolaty aroma and clean finish redeems what may be an otherwise ordinary coffee"" (82). Ken: ""Bittersweet, with dry chocolate and nut tones. A little too bitter and not quite sweet enough for me. The finish is astringent but rich."" (83)",, Nov 2002
83.0,Organic Sumatra,"A typical shape-shifting Sumatra that gives us something different in every cup. Lindsey Bolger: ""Characteristic of a Sumatra prone to schizophrenia, with multiple personalities ranging from toasted grains and nuts to chocolate and spice. This confusing, sometimes combative complexity seems to improve and stabilize as the coffee cools"" (82). Ken: ""Some cups rich, sweet, fruity chocolate with an utterly clean finish; others still sweetly chocolaty but with leathery, spicy undertones and a heavy finish"" (84).",, Nov 2002
83.0,Sumatra Gayoland Dark Roast,"Lindsey Bolger: ""One of my favorites of the darker roasts in the cupping, largely owing to an aromatic note that always gets my attention. I describe it as ""zatar,"" a mix of spices (sumac, thyme, marjoram and salt) used in Middle Eastern cooking. An odd pairing with coffee, but at the right roast and with other complementary flavors, it can contribute to a truly distinctive cup"" (83). Ken: ""Most cups were dominated by sweetly and pleasantly fermented tones, the kind that suggest wine- or fruit-toned chocolate. In other cups, additional smoky, spicy tones edged toward a soapy bitterness"" (84)",, Nov 2002
85.0,Sumatra Blue Batak,"Lindsey Bolger: ""Understated grace describes this uncharacteristically delicate and refined Sumatra. Both dry fragrance and wet aroma display subtle fruit (I describe it as dried orange peel) and milk chocolate, which complement a clean and balanced cup laced with sweet herbs and licorice"" (82). Ken: ""Crisp, balanced, understated but rich. Grapefruit tones complicate a gently acidy but roasty cup"" (88).",, Nov 2002
85.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Lindsey Bolger: ""Intense aroma of fresh-from-oven brownies. Flavors of dark chocolate and sweet caramel compliment the rather dark roast. I added points to acknowledge the roaster's skill in pairing the roast so appropriately to the coffee"" (85). Ken also was impressed by the aroma: ""richly low-toned, chocolaty, malty, spicy, complex. In the cup gently roasty, complicated by dry fruit and malt notes. A slightly astringent finish lowered my score"" (84).",, Nov 2002
85.0,Sumatra,"Lindsey Bolger: ""Engaging aroma of sweet chocolate pudding invites the tasting spoon to dive right in. The cup delivers on the aroma's promise with a body that won't quit and a lingering sweetness that pushes through the rather dark roast"" (83) Ken concurs with both the chocolate and the sweetness: ""Clear sweet cocoa tones, balanced cup, long clean finish"" (87).",, Nov 2002
86.0,Sumatra Gayoland Light Roast,"Lindsey Bolger: ""Depending on tolerance for fruitiness with wild tendencies, this coffee will either delight or dismay. Lovely floral aromatics complemented by flourishes of warmed butter, brown sugar and citrus were the first hint that something interesting was going on in the cup. Upon first sip, the coffee displayed overt ferment, the kind that makes your toes curl. Then, after subsequent passes, that overripe fruitiness evolved to the engaging blueberry note so prized in Ethiopia Harrars"" (84). Ken also wrestled with ambiguous flavor notes that for him suggested both fermented fruit as well as a hint of mustiness, but he too settled on a positive reading: ""sweetly acidy, with lush ferment tones that, as the cup cools, resolve richly and pleasantly to fruity chocolate and brandy"" (87).",, Nov 2002
89.0,Organic Sumatra Gayo,"Lindsey Bolger: ""Fantastic! Sweet, floral aroma accented with cinnamon and just a suggestion of earthiness. Cools to a sweet and clean display of balance and harmony"" (88). Ken read Lindsey's ""earthiness"" as a touch of musty ferment, but he nevertheless liked the way the ferment worked in the darkish roast, describing the outcome as ""pungent, bittersweet fruit that suggests dark chocolate with a little mild, brandy-like ferment."" Like Lindsey, he was impressed with how elegantly the coffee cooled, to a ""long, sweet, clean chocolate finish"" (90).",, Nov 2002
89.0,100% Sumatra Lintong,"Lindsey Bolger exclaims: ""A lovely, well-structured coffee! In the dry fragrance I detected a slightly rancid note, suggesting staling. But after the pour and upon the break, a delightful aroma of brown sugar and cocoa bloomed to mask any lack of freshness. With a maple-syrupy sweetness, bright but restrained acidity and refined fruit notes, this is an excellent example of a classic Sumatra that defies the origin's reputation for earthiness"" (88). Ken concurred, finding ""both aroma and cup dryly acidy yet deeply sweet, lush with a sort of spicy fruit suggesting pineapple. Rich, smooth mouthfeel"" (89).",, Nov 2002
89.0,"Full City Sumatra (Organic, Fair-Trade)","Lindsey Bolger was all positive on this one: ""One of my favorites in the cupping. Chocolate laced with cinnamon punctuates the aroma. More sweet spice and cocoa, even some floral notes, emerge in the flavor. A fine specimen of a Sumatra -- tamed but not over domesticated!"" (88) Ken was attracted by ""an opulent, deep-toned fruity chocolate"" that nevertheless hinted at various flavor ambiguities like ferment. Ultimately, though, a ""rich, clean finish"" convinced him to go with a very positive reading (89) of this complex Sumatra.",, Nov 2002
78.0,Arabian Mocha Java,"""Light-bodied with an almost rioy flavor. Quakers, soft, wild-looking. Could have been better if roasted a little darker?"" (78). Rioy is a hard, medicinal flavor taken on by some dry-processed coffees during the drying. Quakers are beans that fail to take the roast and remain light, robbing the coffee of flavor and body. Ken: ""Burned tones, faint sweetness, not much else"" (78).",, Oct 2002
81.0,Casablanca Blend,"""Medium- to full-bodied blend. Looks like two different roasts blended. Good, full finish"" (81). Ken: ""Sweet charred tones with some smoky spice in the nose. In the cup fruity, acidy tones nicely survive the roast but sweetness doesn't: ultimately a little too bitter for me"" (81).",, Oct 2002
82.0,Dark Sumatra,"John: ""Light bodied, simple profile. Slightly earthy, good looking roast. Nice cover with little inside"" (80). Ken also notes the thinnish mouthfeel and light body, but finds the flavor contrasts interesting and worth rewarding: ""Sharply burned yet sweet and fruity. Dry chocolate in the finish"" (83)",, Oct 2002
83.0,Ethiopia Sidamos,"John Weaver was not excited: ""Medium-bodied, a little flat. Some good wine tones with a little citric flavor"" (80). Ken, who tends to value nuance, rewarded this coffee for its ""sweet roastiness complicated by smoky, fruity chocolate tones that carry from cup through the mildly astringent finish"" (85).",, Oct 2002
83.0,French Roast,"Not much nuance here, but a solid ultra-dark roast. John Weaver: ""Good clean flavor with mellow body and a nice finish"" (83). Ken: ""Balanced dark roast. Bittersweet, medium body, smooth mouthfeel, though a touch astringent in the finish"" (82).",, Oct 2002
84.0,Dark Line Red Eye,"John Weaver: ""Nice medium body with bright, sparkly flavor notes. Tangy flavor"" (81). Ken particularly liked the ""tangy"" character: ""sweetly fruity, with some floral complication, rounded rather than repressed by the roast. Slightly astringent finish"" (87).",, Oct 2002
86.0,Costa Rica,"Both John Weaver and Ken admired this coffee's smooth balance, though Ken found a bit more to say about the cup than John, who writes: ""Good, medium-bodied coffee with smooth flavor and aftertaste"" (84). Ken: ""Pleasant balance of subdued acidy and round roast tones, complicated by sweet fruit chocolate, tastes a whole lot like butterscotch in the finish"" (87).",, Oct 2002
87.0,Italian Roast,"John Weaver: ""Fast roast, singed beans. Nice flavor though. Quick roast means bright acidity. A little slower roast would benefit this coffee"" (85) Ken: ""Elegant balance of fruity chocolate and leathery roast tones. Some bitterness, but softens toward the finish"" (88).",, Oct 2002
91.0,Ethiopian Yirgacheffe,"Both John Weaver and Ken admired this dark-roasted Ethiopia. John: ""My favorite of this cupping. Obviously East African. Bright acidity with exceptional flavor. Nice roast for this coffee, although I might have taken it a hair farther to bring out more body"" (90). Ken: ""Balanced, sweet, deeply dimensioned integration of rounded acidy notes, crisp roastiness and a lush, apricot-toned fruit"" (91).",, Oct 2002
82.0,"Oromia Dark Roast, Fair Trade","This very dark-roasted coffee reveals almost nothing about the potentially interesting green coffee itself except its ability to stand up to a severe degree of roast and still taste quite agreeable. The profile is roasty and charred, but pleasantly free of bitterness and haloed by sweetness.",, Sep 2002
84.0,Ethiopian Harrar,"Lush, sweetly overripe Harrar fruit notes are shadowed by salty and bitter tones. Dry chocolate in the finish.",, Sep 2002
85.0,Best of Africa Blend,Lush floral notes and suggestions of fruity chocolate are pleasantly felt behind a dominating bittersweetness that leans a bit more toward the bitter than the sweet. A floral-toned sweetness softens the astringent finish.,, Sep 2002
86.0,Ethiopia Washed Yirgacheffe Horse,"A dark-roast presentation with a splendid aroma: intense, crisply dry and fruity. In the cup, however, the roast dominates, though patient drinkers will feel a sweet, lush fruitiness behind the roasty bitterness. The halo of fruit persists in the cleanly roasty finish.",, Sep 2002
86.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Horse,"The medium-dark but rather aggressive roast preserves a touch of acidity and lemony sweetness amid the dominant roasty tones. More complex than balanced, the closest sensory analogy I can propose is roasted lemon drops.",, Sep 2002
85.0,Ethiopia Limu Fair-Trade,"A rather aggressive roast contributes distinct charred notes, but they are richly charred notes, with a leathery twist and a tickle of dry fruit. The astringent finish is pleasantly complicated by dry chocolate.",, Sep 2002
87.0,Kenya AA Nyeri Tatu,"The moderately dark-roast style mutes the Kenya fruit and gives it a roasty, tart pineapple twist that softens toward a toasty chocolate in the finish. The darkish roast may transform the Kenya character, but the transformation is quite pleasurable in its own right.",, Sep 2002
87.0,Simply Yirgacheffe,"The medium roast allows the character of the coffee to emerge, in this case richly and sweetly acidy, complicated by sweet nut notes and, as the cup cools, more characteristic Yirgacheffe floral and lemon tones. An unusual coffee in two respects: light roasted in a region (San Francisco Bay Area) where extremely dark roasting prevails, and rather heavy bodied for a Yirgacheffe.",, Sep 2002
90.0,Kenya Medium Dark Roast,"Seductively rich in the nose, with pineapple and orange notes, but all business in the cup: grandly and austerely acidy with pronounced dry, cabernet-like fruit. Softens and sweetens again in the finish.",, Sep 2002
93.0,Kenya Grand Cru,"A Kenya in the grandly classic mode: intense but perfectly balanced, full-bodied, voluptuous with dry red wine and cherry tones, acidy without bitterness. The tactful medium-dark roast rounds the acidity and contributes a slight roasty note.",, Sep 2002
81.0,Mountain Country Viennese Roast,"Considerable disagreement surfaced between Ken and Chris over this blend's odd character contributed by seldom-used coffees like India Monsooned Malabar and wet-processed robusta. Ken rather defiantly settled on a rating of 85, admiring what he called the blend's ""sweet, complexly opulent nose and odd, overripe apricot and bittersweet chocolate notes"" but admitting he found its ""background musty tones disturbing."" Chris (rating 77) didn't buy into the exotic character at all, concluding that the musty (his term is ""earthy"") tones dominated: ""Off the mark, it strides toward a nutty baked bread aroma. The body and acidity tire down to earthy notes midway, but regain some sweet strength in the aftertaste.""",, Aug 2002
84.0,Old City Blend,"Ken admires this blend's ""rich, powerful, low-toned acidity, fullish body, and dry chocolate nuance,"" but is distracted by ""a hint of bitter peanut tones and a cloying background flatness"" (rating 86). Chris is both more specific -- ""dark roast beans blended with very light roast, which hides the borderline past-crop flavor"" -- and more metaphoric: ""This coffee is hanging on for dear life with a shot of sweet wine adrenaline"" (rating 82).",, Aug 2002
85.0,India S795,"Ken admires this coffee's ""almost chewy dry chocolate or cocoa notes"" and its ""sweet, rich balance and well-integrated acidity,"" though he had reservations centering on ""a slight flatly potatoey, bitter mustiness"" (rating 85). Chris finds a positive and colorful way of describing the sample's unorthodox aromatics: ""Impressive variety of aroma in the cup, from honey baked bread to a sweet green-pepper spice, which caught me off guard at first. Finishes with smooth banana-muffin-like notes"" (rating 84).",, Aug 2002
85.0,India MNEB,"Ken: ""Fine balance of sweet, acidy and roasty tones, with a hint of flowers and bittersweet chocolate. The balance breaks up a bit in the rather bitter finish"" (rating 86). Chris: ""Slight pipe tobacco sweetness in the aroma. Smooth, fresh milk chocolate flavor with a hint of sweet jalapeno"" (rating 84).",, Aug 2002
85.0,Mountain Country Indian Kents Plantation A,"Ken: ""Round, balanced, quietly agreeable. A subdued roastiness is nicely enveloped in gently sweet fruit tones"" (rating 86). Chris also appreciates the sweet, round fruit, but objects to the notes Ken calls roasty, condemning them as ""woody"": ""Fragrant honey butter with a hint of a citric bite. However, the sweet creamy character gets lost in the woody nut tones of the finish"" (rating 83).",, Aug 2002
86.0,India Dark Roast,"Issues of roast rather than green coffee dominated reactions to this dark roast, with Ken leaning to the critical side and Chris to the positive. Ken: ""Impressively full-bodied, but  bitterly monotoned and heavy rather than round"" (rating 83). Chris acknowledges that ""most of the [attractive] India sweet pepper flavor has been roasted out of this one. However,"" he continues, ""it deserves merit for a skillful roast that brings out sweet creamy coconut tones without contributing a smoky flavor"" (rating 86).",, Aug 2002
86.0,India Full City Roast,"Both Ken and Chris find the aromatics and body of this dark roast impressive but the finish distracting. Ken: ""Superb aroma, intense, sweet dark-roast character with shimmers of tart grapefruit and milk chocolate. The roast taste pleasantly dominates in the cup but turns charred in the finish"" (rating 84). Chris: ""Opens with nutty, caramel candy; smooth body in the cup. Cools to a touch of earthy, metallic flavor"" (rating 87).",, Aug 2002
90.0,India Jumboor Estate MNEB,"Ken's favorite in the cupping: ""Superb balance of dry and sweet tones. Crisp fruit notes suggest temperate fruit, perhaps pears. Slight but not entirely unpleasant bitterness in the finish"" (rating 90). Chris: ""The other stand-alone in the cupping, owing to its medium-intensity East-Africa-style acidity. Begins with suggestions of mandarin orange and dips toward a floral wine finish"" (rating 89).",, Aug 2002
92.0,India Badnekhan Estate,"""Bright, acidy, but luxuriously sweet -- high-toned, citrusy fruit suggests grapefruit. Slightly astringent in the finish but richly so (rating 88)."" Chris really liked this coffee, awarding it a rating of 96: ""Started things off right with a mouthwatering floral and citrus aroma. Very much the lone wolf of the cupping owing to its winey Yirgacheffe/Kenya character.""",, Aug 2002
83.0,Capricorn Blend Decaffeinated,"Dark roast in the classic bittersweet style, complicated by delicate floral, dry fruit and pipe tobacco notes. A distracting astringency dampens an otherwise balanced, complex dark-roast cup.",, Jul 2002
86.0,Decaf Sumatra,"The darkish roast turns the fruit tones dry and crisply grapefruity. Some charred and perhaps musty notes, but when juxtaposed with the sweet fruit they read as a sort of pleasantly burned chocolate.",, Jul 2002
86.0,Fair Trade Decaf Blend,"Rich, round and balanced, with a sweetly understated acidity. Not a lot of nuance, but a hint of mustiness reads as an agreeably peppery chocolate. The finish is smooth, clean and long.",, Jul 2002
87.0,Decaf Skye’s Mountain Blend,"Simple in terms of nuance but splendid structure: rich and pleasing balance of sweet and roasty tones with a pleasant shimmer of acidity and suggestions of citrus and pineapple. The roast tones are rather heavily bitter when the cup is hot, but soften and round beautifully as it cools.",Price: NA, Jul 2002
87.0,Decaf Mexico Organic,"Intense, rich, straightforward. The aroma is deep-toned bittersweet chocolate with a slight roasty edge. Simplifies in the cup, perhaps under the impact of the roast, but expands again in the finish, with chocolate and hints of flowers.",Price: NA, Jul 2002
87.0,Decaf Louisiana Blend Medium Dark,"Rich, almost disconcertingly distinct peanut tones dominate from aroma to finish. Supporting sweetness turns the peanut character agreeably fruity and chocolaty in the cup.",, Jul 2002
88.0,Decaf Mocca Java,"Dryly acidy but sweet, expansively fruity, distinctly floral. A crisp roastiness turns the fruit toward chocolate. Only a very slight bitter astringency mars this otherwise luxuriously exotic cup.",, Jul 2002
88.0,Colombia Dark Roast Decaf,"Wonderfully robust balance of sweet, roasty, and roundly acidy tones, with sweetness in the ascendancy. Some fruity complication, but the main appeal is pure, classic Latin-America coffee expression. The dark roast rounds and sweetens the acidity but leaves little bitterness behind.",, Jul 2002
88.0,Decaf,"This extreme light-roasted coffee displays the nutty, brisk character of light to medium roasts, but adds an impressive sweetness and richness that less skillfully executed light roasts fail to deliver. Intensely but sweetly acidy; chocolate and nut notes in the aroma, dry fruit and pipe tobacco in the finish.",, Jul 2002
89.0,Ethiopia Sidamo Decaffeinated,"Sweet floral and lemon tones shimmer above rather bitterly pungent bottom notes. The combination of juicy sweetness and pungent bitterness nets a sensation almost pineapple-like in its bracing contradiction. The pungent bottom notes, always present in Sidamos, are heavier than usual here, perhaps owing to the vicissitudes of decaffeination, though they settle and soften as the cup cools.",, Jul 2002
92.0,Sumatra Mandheling Decaf,"Masterpiece of understated balance and completeness: sweetly acidy with a slight edge of crisp roastiness. Some chocolate-toned fruit, but the main appeal of this coffee is its resounding depth and flawless balance of roast and coffee. The finish is as long, rich and quietly complex as any I can remember.",, Jul 2002
82.0,Costa Rica Lomas al Rio Organic,"Ken (rating 81) reports: ""Full-bodied, rather rich, but simple, with little nuance and a hint of bagginess."" Kevin (rating 82): ""Nice body, but the quakery appearance of the beans is reflected in a rather dull cup. Roasted at or past its limit given the modest inherent acidity of the green coffee.""",, Jun 2002
84.0,Costa Rica Tarrazu,"Ken (rating 82) praises this coffee's ""powerful acidity, big body, rich, wine-toned fruit,"" but complains ""the acidity may be a touch bitter, finish astringent."" Kevin (rating 85) is succinctly affirmative: ""Caramel, nice acid-body balance, plush, simple, pure.""",, Jun 2002
85.0,Costa Rica Tres Volcanos,"Ken (rating 85) writes: ""Simple and without nuance, but agreeably envelops pungent roasty and crisply acidy tones in a fundamental sweetness."" Kevin (rating 84): ""Some liveliness, substantial body. Correct but forgettable.""",, Jun 2002
86.0,Costa Rica La Luna Tarrazu,"Ken (rating 86) writes: ""Sweet, round, with an agreeable balance of dry acidy notes and rich roastiness. Perhaps a bit shallow in range and dimension."" Kevin (rating 85): ""A dark roast that hits the 'sweet spot' of old-style Peet's/Starbucks roasting. Acidity in a supporting role but still present, luscious body and noteworthy complexity, all a testament to excellent green coffee and skillful roasting.""",, Jun 2002
86.0,Costa Rica La Magnolia,"Ken (rating 86) writes: ""Sweetly acidy and floral, with roasty chocolate notes - think chocolate-covered flowers. Acidity may be a touch overbearing, finish a bit heavy."" Kevin (rating 86) is not excited: ""Medium-bodied, straightforward, a bit dusty and chalky.""",, Jun 2002
87.0,"Costa Rica Whole Bean, Espresso Roast","Ken (rating 87) praises this ""high-toned, crisply balanced dark roast with a shimmer of grapefruit in the nose and chocolate in the cup."" Kevin (rating 87) also likes it: ""Excellent deep-but-not-dark-roast coffee. Syrupy depth, creamy body, good supporting acidity, rich cocoa and nut flavors.""",, Jun 2002
88.0,Costa Rican Escazu,"For Ken (rating 87), ""clean, crisp, but rich. Chocolate in the nose, flowers and citrus in the cup."" Kevin (rating 89) writes: ""Caramel and nut, fresh, clean, sweet. Not a powerhouse, but subtle, velvety and elegant - all Costa Rica virtues.""",, Jun 2002
88.0,"Costa Rica La Magnolia, 2000/01 crop","Ken's favorite (rating 90) in the cupping: ""Richly acidy and roundly sweet. Grace notes suggest cocoa swooning toward lushly fruity pipe tobacco."" Kevin (rating 86) seems a bit put off by its departure from the Costa Rica norm: ""Lovely caramel aroma, medium-full body, lush bittersweet chocolate flavors that made me wonder which part of Guatemala this Costa Rica was grown in. Hedonistic rather than cerebral in its appeal; delightfully atypical.""",, Jun 2002
88.0,Costa Rica Tres Rios,"For Ken (rating 86) this coffee is ""classic but rather blunt. Pear and caramel notes in the nose but little nuance in the cup."" Kevin (rating 90) acknowledges its limitations, but admires it greatly nonetheless: ""Floral and caramel aromatic notes, medium-full body. Not complex but beautifully balanced, showing further sweetness as it cools.""",, Jun 2002
90.0,"Costa Rica Whole Bean, Light Roast","A consensus pick. ""Cherry- and red-wine-toned fruit; big, rich, full, round, resonant,"" according to Ken (rating 89). Kevin (rating 91) writes: ""Tarrazu-style winy fruit, with floral and caramel notes on the break. Complex and balanced, with nuances of butter caramel, maple and cocoa powder. Great length, resonant, artfully roasted.""",, Jun 2002

88.0,Fazenda Vargem Grande,"An exquisitely delicate coffee. Meltingly sweet and cocoa-toned in the nose, in the cup gently acidy and crisply fruity with cocoa and pear notes. The finish is pleasingly chocolate-toned, but slightly astringent.",, May 2002

87.0,Brazil Fazenda Wagner,"Sweet and complex with grapefruit, lemon and cocoa in the nose. The grapefruit notes dominate and harden a  bit in the pleasingly rich cup, turning slightly astringent in the finish.",, May 2002
87.0,Brazil Serra Negra,"Slight fermented, musty tones pleasingly complicate this sweet, rich, round-bodied Brazil, reading as leather and spice in the nose, and spice, fruit and chocolate in the cup. Just enough acidity to keep the cup lively.",, May 2002
86.0,Brazil Fazenda Wagner,"Delicately acidy but slightly bitter cup displays a subtle but impressive array of aromatic and flavor notes: vanilla and fresh leather in the nose, dry chocolate, flowers, and lemon in the cup.",, May 2002

84.0,Brazil Fazenda Lagoa Natural,"Sweet, low-key, gentle. Displays muted musty/mildew tones that, combined with the essential sweetness of the coffee, read agreeably as malt or dry spice.",, May 2002
82.0,Brazil,"A simple, solid, rather dense-hearted dark roast with pleasing balance of sweet and bitter tones but without much nuance: slight, cocoa-toned fruit in the cup and a hint of lemon in the rather astringent finish.",, May 2002
90.0,Black Cat Espresso,"Heavy, rich, a touch sharp, but balanced in the small cup, complicated nicely by dry fruit and cocoa. Maintains balance and authority in small milk, where the cocoa sweetens toward a voluptuous hazelnut-toned chocolate. Fades a bit in big milk, though still round and chocolaty. (89 straight espresso, 90 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
89.0,Gusto Crema Blend,"Citrus and floral notes float atop pungent fermented fruit tones in the small cup; nut and chocolate notes complicate the finish. Maintains its leathery, spicy complexity in milk, adding a rounder and softer chocolate finish. 88 straight espresso, 89 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
87.0,Espresso Blend,"Splendid in the small cup, sweet, round, balanced, utterly free of sharpness or flaw. Its relative lack of nuance -- mere hints of chocolate and nut -- only emphasize the clarity and completeness of its classic gesture. Disappointing in milk, however: heavy and bitter in small milk,  blunt and flat in large. (89 straight espresso, 84 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
90.0,Caffé Espresso,"An exceptional versatile espresso that maintains complexity and intrigue from small cup to big milk. Nuance ranges from chocolate and walnut to fermented fruit and malty/musty tones. The musty notes are sharp in the finish of the small cup but turn splendidly round and rich in milk. (87 straight espresso, 93 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
88.0,Cable Car Blend,"An appealing combination of orange, chocolate, and floral notes shimmer in the small cup, though shadowed by a roasty sharpness. Milk rounds the cup nicely, however, turning the citrus and floral notes into a crisp, toasty chocolate. Fades slightly in big milk. (87 straight espresso, 89 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
88.0,Espresso Blend,"In the small cup intense and rather lean-bodied but richly sweet, complicated by dry fruit notes and shimmers of flowers and chocolate. In milk smooth, sweet and toasty with a lushly chocolate-toned finish. (87 straight espresso, 88 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
88.0,Brazil Mogiana Bourbon “Safira”,"Smooth, medium-to-full bodied and richly balanced in the small cup, discreetly complicated by crisp leather and dry chocolate notes. Slightly astringent in the finish. Milk amplifies the dry chocolate tones, which turn hearty and bittersweet in short milk drinks and voluptuously sweet in taller.

88.0,Malabar Gold Espresso,"In the small cup full and buttery in body, in flavor grainy, sharply malty/musty, with dry, pleasing cherry-like fruit notes. Cappuccino-quantities of milk sweeten the profile, accentuating the fruit and turning the grainy tones pleasantly nut-like. At its best in big milk, where it its fat, buttery body masters the dairy with pure weight and character rather than with bitterness. (86 straight espresso, 90 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
88.0,Oromo Espresso,"Fermented, wine-like fruit notes agreeably dominate the small cup, though they are shadowed by bitterness, particularly in the finish. The bitterness turns pleasantly bittersweet in cappuccino-sized milk, and flat-out gloriously sweet and chocolate-fruit-toned in big milk. (86 straight espresso, 90 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
87.0,Hawaiian Espresso Molokai Style,"In the small cup rather stingy in body, sharp, without nuance. Milk softens the sharp tones, however, allowing the coffee to develop beautifully, with rich fruit and floral notes leaning toward chocolate. (84 straight espresso, 89 w/milk)",, Apr 2002
85.0,Bizzarri Blend,"A smoky, heavy, bittersweet espresso. In the small cup the smoky, bitter tones overshadow floral and fruit top notes and toasty, leathery midtones.

82.0,Espresso Viennese,"In the small cup sharp, bitter astringency overpowers hints of malty chocolate and dried fruit. Remains sharp and thinly bitter in small volumes of milk; in larger volumes softens to an expansive milk chocolate. (80 straight espresso, 84/milk.)",, Apr 2002

85.0,Medium Roast and Grind,"Understated to the point of self-effacement. The aroma is subdued but sweet and enlivened with a tickle of dry, fruit-toned chocolate. In the cup round, rather deeply dimensioned, with just enough acidity to keep the cup subtle rather than banal.",, Mar 2002

79.0,"French Roast, Whole Bean","When hot, an impressive dark-roast cup: balanced, sweet modulating to bittersweet in the finish; dry, prune-like fruit complications with a pleasant roasty bite. As the cup cools, however, distinct (and rather unpleasant) rubber tones emerge.",, Mar 2002
78.0,Coffee,"About half of a classic American  breakfast cup. The acidy brightness, gently  complicated by a touch of nut-toned sweetness, is there.

86.0,Mexico Chiapas Altura,"The aroma is rich, deeply dimensioned, shot through with bracing grapefruit tones; the body smooth and full. The richly expressed grapefruit tones excite when the cup is hot, but turn a touch bitterish and sharp as it cools, particularly in the finish.",, Dec 2001
85.0,Organic El Salvador,"Roasty, sweet, and round in the nose. In the cup the roastiness reveals a sharp bitterness, brightened by a hint of floral sweetness that softens toward burned chocolate in the finish. A full body offsets the bitterness.",, Dec 2001
84.0,Dutch Flowers Blend,"When hot, rich and balanced, with gently bright grapefruit tones shimmering inside a crisp, invigorating roastiness. As the cup cools the citrus tones turn a bit sharp and the roastiness leans toward burned.",, Dec 2001
82.0,Organic Nicaragua,"The aggressive dark roast simplifies this naturally sweet, chocolaty coffee and turns it a bit monolithic. A deep-toned, dry, chocolate-nuanced roastiness dominates, relieved by only a tickle of sweetness. The finish is richly bittersweet, but hints at rubber as the cup cools.",, Dec 2001
81.0,Organic Aztec Dark,"In the nose, brightly sweet grapefruit tones animate a vaguely spicy roastiness. In the cup the aggressive roastiness turns bitter and slightly charred, lifted only by a shadow sweetness and a memory of citrus. Substantial body.",, Dec 2001
88.0,"Fair Trade Coffee, Light Roast","A richly expansive, deeply dimensioned coffee, caramelly, smooth, with an elegant balance of slightly bitter roasty notes, sweetness, and a gently fruity acidity.",, Aug 2001
87.0,Songbird Shade Grown Costa Rican,"Rich, sweet, with a gentle lift from the acidity, complicated by pronounced chocolate fruit tones (think chocolate-covered cherries). The body reads as bigger than it is owing to the general richness of the cup. Not much range or complexity, but a fundamentally pleasing cup.",, Aug 2001
81.0,Sumatra French Roast,"The aggressive roast agreeably dominates the coffee here. A delicate, floral-toned, buoyant sweetness sings over a pungently charred center. The sweetness fades and the charred tones dominate in the finish.",, Aug 2001
85.0,Organic Sumatran Reserve,"Musty tones are softened by sweetness, and read variously as spicy, smoky, and dryly fruity in the cup, then hint at cocoa in the finish.",, Aug 2001
86.0,Organic Mexican Select,"Lovely, floral top notes float on a sturdy bittersweet structure. Gently bright, light- to medium-bodied. The finish leans toward the bitter side.",, Aug 2001
87.0,Guatemala Atitlan “La Voz”,"Clear, sweet ferment tones are turned cherryish chocolate by the darkish roast. Clean, bittersweet chocolate finish. The winy ferment tones, giddy and buoyant when the cup is hot, flatten just a bit as the cup cools.",, Aug 2001
81.0,Organic Peru La Florida,"Either pleasantly subdued or disappointingly flat, depending on expectation. Roasty and mildly bittersweet, complicated by slight dry, brisk cocoa notes and perhaps some spice tones. The best of the four Perus submitted for this cupping.",, Aug 2001
86.0,Organic Guatemala Highlands,"A rather simple but pleasingly balanced cup: bittersweet, with a low-toned shimmer of acidity. Prune or dried fruit notes in the cup and cocoa in the finish. Holds up very well as it cools.",, Aug 2001
85.0,Organic Costa Rican Dark,"An interesting dark-roast cup. Distinctly charred but full-bodied and rather expansively sweet, with hints of dry pineapple in both aroma and finish and an odd, smoky chocolate twist in the cup. Finishes rather bitterly, like most dark roasts.",, Aug 2001
87.0,Nicaragua Miraflor,"The aroma is remarkable: rich, sweet, caramelly, complete. In the cup substantial, brightly rich, with tickles of citrus and cocoa. The chocolate-toned finish sits rather heavily on the palate.",, Aug 2001
86.0,Beethoven’s Viennese Blend,"Medium-bodied but smooth, sweet, chocolaty, with a glint of dry acidity to animate the sweetness. The roast taste is backgrounded and unobtrusive, wrapped in the chocolate-toned sweetness.",, Aug 2001
86.0,Fair Trade Coffee Decaf,"Rich, balanced, deeply dimensioned, sweet and mouthfilling at the front end, a touch bitter toward the finish. Meadowy hints of flowers waft in the sweetness.",, Aug 2001
93.0,Daybreak Morning Blend,"A classic American breakfast coffee: intensely and brightly acidy but juicily sweet, deeply dimensioned, with meadowy hints of flowers that deepen toward fruit in the finish. As the finish fades, we 're left again with a shimmer of flowers.",, Jun 2001
89.0,Chuck Roast,"Smooth, balanced, with excellent range, from floral top notes through a bright, juicy, acidy middle to a roasty, bitterish bottom. The most impressive aspect of this coffee is its pleasing natural sweetness, which persists from aroma through cup to light-footed but authoritative finish.",, Jun 2001
88.0,Pride of the Andes,"The rich, grapey, slightly fermented fruit taste Guatemalans call avinatado or winyness dominates the profile of this medium-dark-roasted blend, together with the intensely and fleetingly sweet innuendoes we associate with dusk flowers like jasmine or honeysuckle. The finish is sweet, almost juicy.",, Jun 2001
87.0,Moto Brew,"An impressively full-bodied and deeply dimensioned darker-roasted blend. Richly spicy, bitter but round, with a hint of dry, prune-like fruit. The spice and prune tones complicate the bitter but rich finish.",, Jun 2001
86.0,Solstice Blend,"Complex and exotic, this moderately dark-roasted blend sits sharply but sweetly on the palate. Floral notes and faintly ferment-toned fruit complicate the cup, but both nuance and sweetness fade in the finish, leaving behind a roasty bitterness some coffee drinkers may find pleasingly pungent, others a touch overbearing.",, Jun 2001
86.0,Viennese Blend,"Powered by the earthy, slightly musty, forest-floor notes of (I assume) Sulawesi or Sumatra coffees, with an added touch of acidy brightness and sweetness. The earthy notes hint pleasantly at chocolate. Marred by a slight metallic note as the cup cools.",, Jun 2001
85.0,Dolphin Blend,"The clean nut-like notes and undertone of spice are unusual for a moderately dark-roasted coffee like this one. The body is impressively full, the finish roasty and pungent with a mild but pleasing bitterness.",, Jun 2001
85.0,Polly’s Blend,"Here the whole is more than the parts. A balanced structure of sweetness and bitterness and a plump, smooth body compensate for a relative lack of nuance. For some coffee drinkers, the bitterness may assert itself a bit too strongly in the aftertaste.",, Jun 2001
85.0,Gamble House Blend,"A pleasingly balanced American cup. Nut and vanilla tones shimmer in the nose and a comfortable sweetness predominates in the cup, lifted by a discreet acidity. Bitter undertones confer authority to the cup but tend to dominate in the rather flat aftertaste.",, Jun 2001
84.0,Wake Up! Carolina,"A breakfast blend with a good deal of character but little balance or coherence. The sweet front end with its pleasingly exotic edge of floral notes and ferment-toned fruit (Ethiopia Harrars?) is precariously supported by a smoky, pungent dark-roast bottom. Eventually, however, the roasty bitterness prevails in a rather severe finish.",, Jun 2001
84.0,Alan’s Blend,"The virtue here is a round and gentle sweetness, the weakness simplicity. The sweetness fades a bit in the finish.",, Jun 2001
86.0,Eastern Carolina Morning Blend,"A full-bodied, richly acidy morning blend laced with dry fruit tones. A slight astringency haunts the cup, masked by rich aromatics when the cup is hot, but a bit puckerish as the coffee cools.",, Jun 2001
89.0,Special Reserve – Green,"A splendidly pure, clear, ringing profile, with a sweet floral acidity some jurors compared to the great Kenya coffees. A hint of deeper, pruny fruit gave the profile ballast and authority. My initial score almost perfectly matched the collective score, but as the cup cooled it seemed to simplify and to allow the acidity to dominate. Hence my mildly dissenting score.",, Apr 2001
92.0,Indonesian Kalossi,"Superb range: delicate floral top notes, sweet cherryish middle, bitter, muskily animal bottom. A full but subtle sweetness prevails in the cup, a rich bitterness in the aftertaste. As exotic and complex as a gamelon performance.",, Mar 2001
90.0,Celebes Kalossi,"A superb Sulawesi: rich, big-bodied but smooth, with a shimmer of acidity animating its heart. Elegant balance of bitter and sweet tones, fine range from middle to bottom of the profile, a hint of flowers, and deep, dry plum-wine fruitiness.",, Mar 2001
90.0,Sulawesi Toraja,"Rich, sweet and clean throughout, with a chewy fullness and a tickle of acidity in the cup, an excellent balance of sweetness and bitterness in underlying structure, and a gentle fade toward chocolate in aftertaste.",, Mar 2001
88.0,Celebes Toraja Kalossi,"A hint of cinnamon in the nose and cocoa in the finish, but the main pleasure here is the underlying structure: low-toned, rich, dry, balanced, and opulently, almost meatily, full-bodied.",, Mar 2001
87.0,Celebes Kalossi,"Very low-toned, smooth, with a dry, fruity bittersweetness that, with slow drinking, settles toward chocolate. A slight, musty astringency shows up in the aftertaste, but the pleasantly pruny bittersweetness prevails.",, Mar 2001
86.0,Sulawesi,"Replete with earth, leather, and vaguely animal and forest notes. In structure leans more toward the bitter side of bittersweet, but blooms with chocolate opulence for a moment toward the finish.",, Mar 2001
85.0,Celebes,"A fine sweet, roasty nose with hints of spice and leather. In the cup the spice and animal notes deepen toward earth and mustiness. The relatively light roast allows a touch of acidity to brighten the cup, but fails to develop the underlying sweetness.",, Mar 2001
84.0,Sulawesi Toraja Dark,"The rather aggressive dark roast simplifies the coffee, intensifying the bitter tones, dampening the sweet, and turning hints of chocolate toward spice. The aftertaste is attractively bittersweet but thin.",, Mar 2001
85.0,Aged Sumatra,,, Dec 2000
86.0,Brazilian Cerrado Capim Branco,"Crisp rather than bright, dry rather than acidy, bittersweet, cocoaish, elegant but limited. From a well-run farm in the relatively new growing region of Cerrado. Martinez Fine Coffees is known for its elegant packaging and respectful presentation of single-origin coffees.",Price: NA, Dec 2000
81.0,India Monsoon Malabar,"The charred tones of the aggressive dark roast are relieved by a substantial sweetness and twisty, musty tones that publicists often label chocolate. They aren ‘t chocolate, but they can be pleasantly intriguing, as they are here. Beans are coated after roasting with acid-neutralizing agenMonsooned coffees have been exposed deliberately to moisture-laden monsoon winds in […]",, Dec 2000
80.0,Blue de Brasil,"Sweet, caramelly and resonant in the nose, but a smoky pungency dominates the cup and turns unpleasantly rubbery as the cup cools. Blue de Brasil is an organically grown estate coffee. A ‘Roma Roasters is a quality-oriented, small-batch roaster located just north of the San Francisco Bay Area.",, Dec 2000
70.0,"Tamer Low Acid Coffee Beans, Regular","Flat, dull, with a heavy, tongue-coating bitterness. The only identifiable flavor note is rubber. Beans are coated after roasting with acid-neutralizing agents, including potassium (but not including aluminum). “Full flavor — less acid!” exclaims the bag copy.",, Dec 2000
85.0,Indian Mysore Plantation,"Balanced, round, smooth, full-bodied, with a dry, pruny heaviness to the fruit and a seductive cocoa finish. A bit more sweetness would make this mouthfilling coffee a very impressive entrant in the low-acid sweepstakes. Mysore Plantation is a wet-processed coffee (the fruit is removed before the beans are dried) from the district where, in around […]",, Dec 2000
85.0,Classique High Roasted,"Not acidy, but definitely dry, with a pleasantly malty, cocoaish finish and a rich little tickle of balancing sweetness. Quite agreeable, but haunted by a hint of rubbery flatness. A blend from Café La Semeuse, a much admired Swiss roaster. Roasted in Switzerland. A sticker on the bag reads “Never Bitter.”",, Dec 2000
83.0,Low Acid Arabica,"A touch of sweet but acidy brightness survives the steam treatment, together with restrained floral and dry, wine-toned fruit notes. The understated but brisk cup is marred by a dull, salty sensation that intensifies as the coffee cools. Treated to remove acidity by a “patented, natural steaming process involving no harmful chemical solvents.” Trader Joe […]",, Dec 2000
83.0,Sumatra,"Just enough sweetness and caramel softness survive the dark roast to balance its charred pungency. A hint of something fruity shimmers toward the top of the profile — I want to call it pineapple. The motto of Silver Canyon Coffee, a small-batch wholesale roaster founded in 1985, is “Pure Quality.”",, Dec 2000
83.0,Guatemala Antigua with Coffee Tamer added,"The acidity is definitely flattened. Unfortunately, everything else except body is flattened too, including sweetness. Pleasant tickles of flowers and spicy fruit survive, echoing in a Tums-toned emptiness. I treated each cup of an acidy, explosively floral- and fruit-toned Guatemala (originally rated over 90) with a little pre-measured packet of Coffee Tamer acid-buffering agent. The […]",, Dec 2000
88.0,Nicaragua Segovia Organic/Fair Trade,"Subdued, low-toned, smooth, full, round. Very little at the top of the profile, but a rich, fat fruitiness in the middle. Giddy suggestions of guava darkened toward cocoa and cherry as the cup cooled.",, Sep 2000
88.0,Organic Mexican Select,"Powerfully, richly, uncompromisingly acidy. Some cocoa or chocolate tones in the finish, but otherwise simply big, dry, and robust.",, Sep 2000
88.0,Elders Blend Gourmet Mayan Coffee,"Light-footed but discreetly smooth, almost creamy, with a lovely balance of acidy and sweet tones. Hints of fruit turn cocoaish toward the finish. Limited but elegant.",, Sep 2000
86.0,Aztec Harvest Breakfast Blend,"Medium bodied but light-footed; smooth, sweet, and buoyant with exhilarating lemon and chocolate tones. A slight pungency balances the cup.",, Sep 2000
86.0,La Esperanza,"Rich, grapy fruit lifts off pleasantly from a smoke-toned, rather sharply bitter base. Wonderful aspiration in this blend, but to my palate the bitterness contradicts rather than complements the luxury of the fruit.",, Sep 2000
84.0,Guatemalan Aroma Roast,"Pleasantly dry, brisk, slightly pungent, with an intriguing twist to the fruit -- spice perhaps, cocoa definitely.",, Sep 2000
82.0,Peru Mid-Roast,"Balanced but subdued. Acidy brightness and hints of fruit and chocolate are dampened by a bitter pungency. For the patient, a hint of lavender in the finish.",, Sep 2000
80.0,Viennese Roast,"Gritty, smoky, low-toned and ponderous. Some sweetness peers out from under the rather bitter heaviness.",, Sep 2000
84.0,Mexican Mid/Light Roast,"Light, dryly fruity, complicated by pleasant cocoa tones. Simple, ingenuous, agreeable. Not sweet, but stays on the gentle side of bitter.",, Sep 2000
84.0,Fair-Trade Organic Nicaraguan,"A dominating roast flushes out most nuance, but imparts a pleasantly dry, cocoaish character to an elegantly crisp cup. Gently austere.",, Sep 2000
90.0,Nizza Blend,"Impressive complexity: high, sweet notes, caramel in the middle, crisp, edge-of-burned tones, a touch of floral acidity. Excellent body. Pungent, bitter tones propose sugar for the demitasse, but give this blend tremendous staying power in milk, where it blossoms with little loss of range or complexity.",, Aug 2000
89.0,Gold Medal Blend,"The aroma is clean and high-toned with innuendo of fresh leather. The demitasse is complex but controlled, with a classic balance of sweetness and bitterness embellished by cocoa and nut notes and a crisp shimmer of acidity. In discreet amounts of milk seductive with caramel and cocoa tones.",, Aug 2000
87.0,Espresso,"Clean, elegant, balanced. Fragrant with toast, nut, and caramel notes in aroma, suave in body. The straightforward balance of bitter and sweet tones in the demitasse is complicated by the slightest edge of floral acidity and dry fruit. Light, bright and sweet in milk.",, Aug 2000
87.0,Espresso Vita,"This espresso, dominated by a musty flavor, showed best at a rather quick extraction, which encouraged the mustiness to read as crisply effervescent, exhilaratingly spicy cocoa. Extremely heavy body and rich crema. Carries very well in milk.",, Aug 2000
86.0,Espresso,"A balanced, straightforward West-Coast American espresso. In the demitasse bittersweet with a slant toward the bitter side, complicated by brisk cocoa tones. Medium-bodied but smooth. The cocoa tones turn agreeably fruity in milk, where the shot softens without losing character.",, Aug 2000
86.0,Espresso Ticino,"Superb aroma: rich, sweet, opulent with cocoa, flowers, and vanilla. A touch disappointing in the demitasse, however; the body is rather lean and the flavor acidy and sharp. But the sharpness rounds beautifully in milk with a lovely balance of dry cocoa tones and sweetness.",, Aug 2000
86.0,Espresso Sessuale,"The demitasse confirms the bag copy: This is an intense blend. Intensely sweet, but even more intensely bitter; a strong gesture but a simple one. Softens and rounds a bit in milk, but maintains its bitter edge.",, Aug 2000
85.0,Organic Neapolitan Espresso,"The smoky tones are sweet and floral in the nose, but rather sharply pungent in the demitasse, where the flowers transform to pruny dry fruit with a hint of burned tones. Excellent in milk, which softens and sweetens the sharpness.",, Aug 2000
95.0,Finca La Tacita,"Irrepressibly buoyant, superbly balanced. The acidity shimmers in the heart of a meadow of floral-toned sweetness. The aftertaste is clean, long, lavender. Exquisite, elegant, precious.",, Jun 2000
92.0,Boquete Region Panamanian Coffee,Powerful yet smooth and sweetly balanced. The acidity is round and ripe. High-toned fruit -- pears perhaps -- deepen toward roasty dry prune and bittersweet chocolate in the finish.,, Jun 2000
91.0,El Salvador,"Classic, clean, complete, elegantly powerful. The acidity sings rather than stings: It is bright yet full-toned and winy. The aftertaste is richly dry without sharpness.",, Jun 2000
90.0,Panama La Torcaza,"Medium bodied, high-toned but smooth, a quintessential American cup, from the vanilla-nut, sweetly acidy nose to the long swoon of the chocolaty finish.",, Jun 2000
90.0,Panama – Baru Estate,"A classic Central-America coffee dominated by a richly powerful acidity, a fat body, and a round, sweet, chocolaty finish.",, Jun 2000
90.0,Costa Rica Taparto,"A big, centered, complete Central-America- style coffee. Brightly acidy in the upper ranges, richly sweet in the lower, with hints of flowers and cedar in the nose and distinct chocolate in the finish. Displayed its true character as it cooled -- rather than falling apart, it opened up, revealing still more nuance.",, Jun 2000
88.0,House Blend,Agreeably balances roast pungency and classic high-grown acidity. The roast rounds the acidity and turns the fruit richly dry.,, Jun 2000
85.0,Nicaraguan Maragogipe Light Roast,"A coffee that requires patience. The aroma is rather flat, the cup smoothly full but inert. A pleasant chocolate sensation surprises in the finish, however, and the aftertaste is sweet, rich and long.",, Jun 2000
85.0,Guatemalan Antigua,"The essence of brisk: a light, bright, acidy cup. Dry tones dominate the sweet undercurrents. A shimmer of flowers, a wisp of smoke, a hint of tart, winey fruit. Pleasant but thinly dimensioned.",, Jun 2000
83.0,El Salvador Borbollon,"The rather aggressive roast drives off nuance and sweetness, but the cup stays on the pleasantly pungent side of charred. A twist of acidity, some flowers and a hint of dry, pruny fruit survive the roast.",, Jun 2000
84.0,Yemen Mocha Mattari – Green,"A classically sweet, chocolaty, fruity Yemen Mattari flawed by a slight touch of baggy staleness. Some on the panel were more than willing to overlook the staleness. ""This [coffee] has character!"" exclaimed one. ""Hint of staleness, but then nice depth.""",, May 2000
93.0,Organic Timor,"The quintessentially smooth, deep, rich Pacific coffee. Not so much complex as dense with sensation. Refined, crisply seductive cocoa tones carry elegantly from aroma to aftertaste.",, Apr 2000
91.0,Guatemalan Organic,"A classic Guatemala in the lighter, softer mode: floral, gently acidy, high-toned but deeply dimensioned. Flowers permeate even the slight bitterness of the roast. A coffee as pure, sweet-toned and brightly complex as a Guatemalan weaving.",, Apr 2000
91.0,Organic East Timor,"Acidy but balanced, softly powerful, saturated by elegantly dry cocoa tones and a touch of deep-toned, winey fruit. The cocoa tones linger exquisitely in the aftertaste.",, Apr 2000
89.0,Papua New Guinea Organic,"A ripe, almost overripe, sweetness carries giddily from aroma to finish, anchored by a discreet touch of roast pungency. The lush fruit tones flirt with ferment but stay on the sweet side. A wonderfully juicy, deeply dimensioned coffee.",, Apr 2000
88.0,Guatemala Atitlan,"A hint of ferment pleasantly hovers between chocolate and cherry-toned, overripe fruit. The darkish roast turns the sweet fruit dryly rich.",, Apr 2000
87.0,El Paraiso,"A light-bodied but complexly nuanced coffee: brightly acidy, floral toned, with fruit tones that hint at chocolate in aroma and aftertaste. Not quite enough sweetness to offset the roast-induced bitterness, however.",, Apr 2000
87.0,Peruvian Organic,"Nicely balanced sweetness and chocolate-toned roast pungency, complicated by a touch of pruny fruit. A bit simple and monotoned, but pleasantly and deeply so, like good minimalist music.",, Apr 2000
86.0,Organic Bolivian,"A solid if unexceptional Latin-American cup: Clean, bright acidy notes are complicated by a roasty bitterness, but the cup misses the enveloping sweetness that would bring both into harmony.",, Apr 2000
85.0,Decaf Organic Sumatra Gayo Mountain,"A sharp, monotoned flatness sits in the middle of the profile. Under and around it a delicious, delicately floral-toned sweetness peeks out. Pleasant dry fruit undertones.",, Apr 2000
82.0,Organic French Roast,"Floral notes float shimmering atop the rather sharp, bitter, burned tones of the roast. Not much sweetness, but the subtle perfume of the flowers compensates.",, Apr 2000
88.0,Sumatra Decaf,"Thrillingly sweet and buoyant when hot, with a hint of dry fruit modulating to chocolate. Light bodied but deeply dimensioned. A subliminal whiff of flowers teases in the aftertaste.",, Mar 2000
88.0,House Blend Decaf,"Big in every respect: in its richly powerful acidity, in body, in general statement. No floral innuendoes or fruity digressions here: This coffee is as abstractly dry, robust and mouthfilling as a good cabernet.",, Mar 2000
86.0,Kenya AA Swiss Water Decaf,"A pleasant, if odd-tasting, Kenya: full body, very little acidity, dominated by a sweet, rounded agreeably spicy flavor that suggests cardamom, cinnamon, pepper, even chicory. The most recognizable Kenya characteristic of this coffee is a deep, ringing dimension.",, Mar 2000
86.0,Appassionato Decaf,"A symphony at the top of the profile: The acidy is sweetly ingratiating, the cup pleasingly light, delicately alive with fruit and floral tones. Flowers and citrus linger in the long, clean aftertaste. Not much in the bass range, however, except a smoky, pungent twist. Drink it hot; the splendid aromatics vanish quickly, leaving behind only pungent silence.",, Mar 2000
85.0,Sumatra Decaf,"A subdued but gently satisfying Sumatra: clean, dry, low-toned fruit is bracketed by a shimmer of flowers at the top of the profile and a hint of pungency toward the bottom. Light-bodied and perhaps a bit shallow in dimension.",, Mar 2000
84.0,Decaf Pure Mocha Java,"The bittersweet tang of the dark roast almost overwhelms the coffee, but agreeable if subdued wine-toned fruit notes survive. The finish flirts with the burned rubber sensation of faulty roasting, but the innate sweetness of the coffee prevails and turns the dubious taste vaguely but agreeably chocolate.",, Mar 2000
84.0,Mountain Country Decaf House Blend,"Bright rather than brisk. A classic combination of high-toned sweetness and gently dry acidity, animated by floral top notes. Only a faint touch of greenness or grassiness mars an otherwise fine American-style breakfast cup.",, Mar 2000
84.0,Sumatra Swiss Water Decaf,"A sweet, high-toned coffee with a distinct musty or mildewy edge. The mustiness imparts a spicy, cocoa-like twist to the pruny fruit notes.",, Mar 2000
85.0,Decaf Colombian Excelso,"An uneven coffee, heartbreakingly uneven, given that some of the cups are extraordinary: exhilarating floral tones are balanced by a dry pungency, all wrapped in a comforting, enveloping sweetness. Other cups, however, lack the floral sweetness and are merely pungent bordering on bitter.",, Mar 2000
86.0,Decaffeinated Guatemalan SWP,"Dry but not acidy, dominated by a pleasantly smoky-toned cocoa sensation that sweetens toward chocolate in the finish. As usual, the Swiss Water Process simultaneously deepens and dampens taste: The body is full but the flavor understated.",, Mar 2000
81.0,"Decaf Good, Strong Blend","A rather sharp pungency dominates this dark-roast blend, looming over some rather cowed dry fruit tones. A spicy sweetness shimmers here and there, notably in aroma and aftertaste.",, Mar 2000
81.0,Papua New Guinea – Sigri,"Panelists described a clean-tasting, agreeable coffee that was perhaps too agreeable, low-key to a fault. ""Good balance, but not much to balance,"" complained one panelist. ""Nothing really to grab onto,"" wrote another. Finished well, with a hint of chocolate, and the cup seemed to strengthen in character a bit as it cooled.",, Feb 2000
81.0,Papua New Guinea – Mile-High,"This sweet, deep-toned coffee with its pruny fruit notes edging toward chocolate attracted considerable praise, though some panelists expressed ambivalence: ""some character but not too interesting next to others""; ""[a kind of] sweet, fruity flavor that I don 't much care for."" Perhaps a faded mustiness restrained this coffee 's considerable potential.",, Feb 2000
78.0,Timor Aifu,"Split vote, split coffee. The yeas responded to a bright, brisk, floral-and-fruit-toned richness with sweet cedar innuendoes. The nays were disturbed by hard, off-tasting undertones, perhaps a baggy mustiness.",, Feb 2000
76.0,Papua New Guinea Organic,"A coffee whose interesting sweet fruit tones (""apricot"" hazarded one panelist) edge into ferment, the overripe-cum-rotten flavor caused by sugars that prematurely ferment in the coffee fruit, tainting the bean inside the fruit. Complicating the ferment is a related off taste that some panelists tolerated and described with terms like ""tobaccoey"" and others condemned as ""animal-like"" and ""skunky."" In short, a promisingly sweet, complex coffee gone wrong.",, Feb 2000
85.0,Papua New Guinea – Arona,"A classically bright yet sweet cup shimmering with seductive floral and wine-like fruit notes. This coffee attracted lavish praise from the panel: ""fruity, floral, working well together""; ""noble fruit notes!""; ""[light] body but very clean like a great Pinot""; ""rich, sweet, very aromatic."" Given such enthusiasm, why didn 't this fine coffee attract a higher aggregate rating? Perhaps owing to its relatively light body, perhaps owing to the barest hint of astringent imbalance in the acidity.",, Feb 2000
82.0,Java Jampit Estate,"""A sweet, inoffensive little cup of coffee. No bells and whistles here,"" wrote one panelist. At first I was inclined to agree, but this soft, subtle coffee eventually won me over with its relaxed richness and striking lavender-like floral tones. Other panelists agreed. Perhaps no bells and whistles, but some pleasant warbling.",, Feb 2000
79.0,Timor Maubesse,"Very uneven from cup to cup. The best cups: low-toned, smooth, with a touch of spicy, clove-like pungency and a sweet, cocoaish finish. The less-than-best cups: bland with a slight but disturbing astringency.",, Feb 2000
78.0,Timor Organic,"An agreeably sweet coffee with pungent bottom notes, but wildly uneven from cup to cup. A grassy, green taste marred some cups; others clearly displayed the overripe-edging-on-rotten taste of ferment. Some combined both problems, in a sort of bouquet of defects.",, Feb 2000
82.0,Papua New Guinea – Kalanga,"I suspect only a slight astringency in the aftertaste prevented this Papua New Guinea from pushing up near the top of the ratings. Panelists liked its smoky aroma (""brownies baking"" said one), its soft sweetness, and its understated character. Its rather metallic, salty astringency was barely detectable, but, once observed, distracting.",, Feb 2000
87.0,Papua New Guinea – Purosa,"Most members of the panel loved this coffee. Favorite adjectives: Aroma: caramelly and floral. Acidity: sweet and bright. Body: creamy and full. Flavor: floral, fruity, complex, balanced. Aftertaste: clean and resonant. Two panelists dissented, one of whom acknowledged the floral notes but dismissed them as ""past-their-prime lilacs.""",, Feb 2000
82.0,Papua New Guinea – Sigri,"Low-key, with a pungent intrigue in the nose that most panelists identified as nut, but which hinted at something more carnal. I was reminded of a combination of bouillon and prunes. Another panelist was less specific but more evocative: ""Odd perfume notes that linger on the tongue. Musky, sweaty flavor.""",, Feb 2000
81.0,House Blend,"An understated dark-roast profile: distinctly bitter, but with a hint of elevating sweetness and an elegant little shimmer of fruit and flowers.",, Jan 2000
78.0,Maxwell House Rich French Roast,"Remarkably sweet, and rather heavy-bodied. The sweetness here is purely a taste sensation, however. No fruity or other aromatic nuances complicate it. The only intrigue is provided by a hint of hardness or mustiness.",, Jan 2000
77.0,House Blend,"When hot, understated but pleasantly sweet, with a hint of spicy fruit complicating the mildly burned, pungent tones. The aftertaste is unyieldingly bitter, however, and when the cup cools the coffee lands on the palate with a flat, unrelieved, carbon-toned thud.",, Jan 2000
72.0,Folgers Coffee House French Roast,"Absolutely neutral. I kept telling myself that I had to be tasting something, but I couldn 't say what: a vague heaviness with a hint of sweetness, perhaps.",, Jan 2000
71.0,Hills Brothers French Roast,"A pleasant, if slight, hazelnut sweetness hovers in the aroma. The cup is vaguely sweet but essentially tasteless except for a hint of pungency probably deriving from hard or musty blend components.",, Jan 2000
86.0,Moka Java,"Floral, sweet, high-toned and as giddy as a field of flowers, with some pungent richness and substance underneath. Ramps down toward clean cocoa tones in the finish.",, Jan 2000
83.0,MJB Hawaiian Blend,"Low-toned but solid, with a nice balance of understated acidy tones and sweetness. Some muted dry fruit notes contribute a throaty murmur in the background. Lacks intensity and range, but sound, round and satisfying.",, Jan 2000
82.0,Breakfast Blend,"A subdued cup, but pleasantly balanced with pungent and sweet tones that together read as prunes, dried fruit or, in a bit of a stretch, chocolate.",, Jan 2000
81.0,Yuban 100% Colombian,"Sweet yet dryly bright, lightly acidy with shimmers of wine and flowers. As the coffee cools the grace notes settle toward chocolate. Not much body, dimension or staying power, but a lively, balanced cup.",, Jan 2000
76.0,Folgers Aroma Roasted,"I 'd call this heavy-bodied coffee rich if there was anything to be rich. The aroma is pleasantly sweet, but the cup displays -- quite literally -- no flavor whatsoever, only primary taste sensation, a sort of heavy emptiness with insinuations of bitterness and sweetness.",, Jan 2000
74.0,Chock Full O’Nuts,"The aroma is faint and faintly sweet. The cup displays a pruny fruitiness that plays peek-a-boo with a distinctly unpleasant rubbery taste. In the finish the sweetness prevails, though barely.",, Jan 2000
73.0,Original Blend,"Overwhelmingly musty. If you don 't understand musty, imagine the smell (or taste) of old shoes at the bottom of a damp closet. The mustiness is haloed with sweetness when the cup is hot, but as the coffee cools nothing remains except mustiness: flat and oppressive.",, Jan 2000
79.0,French Roast,"This blend expresses the usual bitter-but-sweet paradox of dark-roast coffees with particular intensity. The sweetness is almost sugary and the burned bitterness dramatically sharp. Not much range, development or weight, but the cup does offer a pleasant tickle of fruit and lavender. The bitterness outlasts the sweetness in the aftertaste.",, Jan 2000
78.0,Dark Roast,"Just enough sweetness to make the smoky, burned tones bittersweet and cocoa-like rather than simply bitter. And just enough lightness and lift to keep the burned tones from smothering the palate.",, Jan 2000
86.0,Aztec Harvest Breakfast Blend,"A coffee that meets us with a smile, giving everything out front: gently brisk acidity, a touch of wine-toned fruit, floral sweetness. Thereafter it stands pat, light-bodied and balanced, perhaps a bit shallow in dimension.",, Dec 1999
92.0,Kenya AA Grand Cru,"Animated by an almost effervescently dry, winy fruit elevated by hints of flowers. Sweetens slightly in the shimmers of the fruity finish.",, Dec 1999
93.0,Kenya AA,"Rich, deep, intense, with the dry fruit robustness of a cabernet and the tartly sweet black currant notes so cherished by lovers of Kenya. In the finish swoons into a ringing, almost sugary sweetness.",, Dec 1999
89.0,La Minita Estate Tarrazu,"Metaphor fails. This is a coffee that refers to nothing except what it is: a superb coffee, grand yet elegant, dry yet sweet, balanced, full-bodied, complete.",, Dec 1999
87.0,Santos Best,"Smooth, subtle, and above all, sweet. Buoyantly soft rather than bright or brisk, with sweet nut tones in the aroma and sweet chocolate in the finish.",, Dec 1999
88.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"The cup is redolent with the fresh, sweet perfume of clay. Slightly musty tones give a dry, pungent edge to aroma and aftertaste, framing the sweetness in the cup.",, Dec 1999
85.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Pungently rich and round in the nose. In the cup the signature hard mustiness is balanced by sweetness, particularly in the finish.",, Dec 1999
89.0,Yemen Mattari,"A very clean, bright version of the fruity Yemen cup: the wine tones are rich and smooth, with only a hint of sweet ferment near the finish. Surprising floral notes at the top and a long, clean, sweet, chocolate-toned aftertaste.",, Dec 1999
90.0,"Finca La Tacita, Estate Peaberry","Full yet majestically buoyant. The aroma soars with sweet nut notes, the cup glistens with fruit and flowers, the entire impression is gentle but enormous. The finish is aggressively dry but saved from astringency by rich cocoa tones.",, Nov 1999
89.0,Celebration Caffe,"Alive with the slightly wild fruit and dry-wine tones of the great dry-processed coffees of Yemen and Ethiopia. In the wonderfully long, sweet finish the fruit tones darken deliciously toward chocolate.",, Nov 1999
87.0,Vermont Country Blend,"The aroma is magnificent: high, sweet and singing. The cup is gently bright, with a pear or apple sweetness and a touch of pungency in the mid tones. The slight green tones are so sweet they 're more meadowy than grassy.",, Nov 1999
86.0,The Elves Imperial Breakfast Blend,"Dry acidy tones combine nicely with a restrained roasty pungency. Good, deep dimension, but little sweetness to support the deeply tart fruit notes.",, Nov 1999
86.0,Malulani Estate,"This intriguing, low-toned coffee is neither balanced nor coherent, but definitely engaging. The rather hard first impression instantly softens and sweetens, revealing odd, richly herbal notes. The herbal notes persist in the aftertaste, haloed by sweetness.",, Nov 1999
86.0,Jamaican Blue Mountain – Mavis Bank,"Understated, barely felt dry tones animate a roundly balanced cup embellished by teasing hints of deep-toned fruit and a shimmer of flowers. In the rich, long finish the fruit modulates toward chocolate. As the coffee cools a slight flatness mars the profile, perhaps a drying fault. I evaluated this coffee mainly on the basis of its full, lovely balance when hot.",, Nov 1999
83.0,Christmas Blend,"The earthy tones of the Indonesias dominate, sweet in the nose but dry and cocoa-like on the palate. A hint of winy fruit tries to raise its head above the dry earth and cocoa but subsides into the taciturn briskness of the cup.",, Nov 1999
85.0,Holiday Blend with Spices,"Pleasant and interesting, although to my taste the coffee component is not quite sweet or heavy-bodied enough to completely support the spice. A sharp tickle of pepper and clove with a hint of cinnamon sweetness complicates a straightforward, low-key cup.",, Nov 1999
85.0,Italian Roast,"A pure, classic dark-roast gesture. Unusually full body for a roast this dark: smooth, balanced, round in the cup, with a sweetness at the core of the dark-roast pungency that opens like a glimpse of a meadow through a curtain of pines.",, Nov 1999
85.0,Christmas Blend,"A dry but lively dark roast with a nutty, spicy twist at its pungently roasty heart. Rather light, roast-attenuated body, but the finish is buoyant, almost effervescent, with a subliminal hint of chocolate.",, Nov 1999
83.0,Turkish Delight,"A big-bodied darkish blend with hints of sweet fruit that doesn 't quite get off the ground. The heart of the coffee remains sweet and full but rather inert. Perhaps best in the long aftertaste, when the sweet tones are freed of the gritty encumbrances of body and texture.",, Nov 1999
80.0,Mountain Man Blend,An unusually full body gives the dominating pungency of this extreme dark roast solidity and substance. Some smoky notes and high-toned sweetness survive the rigors of the roast.,, Sep 1999
79.0,Roaster Blend,"Pungent and woody out front, with winy, fruity undertones turned toward dry chocolate by the roast. A hint of flowers in the finish. Marred by an overly aggressive roast: Flat, charred tones verging on creosote sit on an otherwise expansive, complex profile.",, Sep 1999
89.0,Ethiopian Harrar “Horse”,"Tremendous but balanced range and dimension. The acidity is full, deep, sweet, enveloped in the unifying matrix of the cup. Circumspect hints of fruit and flowers emerge in finish and aftertaste. As the coffee cools the slightest hint of ferment reveals itself behind the rich aromatics of the cup.",, Sep 1999
87.0,"Ethiopia Washed Sidamo, Vienna Roast","Amazingly, behind the dampening effect of the aggressive dark roast a delicate, exquisite floral sweetness survives among the equally delicate charred, pungent notes. Think of a meadow that survived a forest fire.",, Sep 1999
85.0,"Organic Timor Aifu, Vienna Roast","A dark roast that tip-toes past burned to achieve a smooth, integrated bittersweetness, enlivened by a hint of acidity and a touch of fruit.",, Sep 1999
81.0,Paia Blend,"This coffee opens opulently, with a complex, enveloping aroma alive with nutty, spicy, bittersweet tones. In the cup the profile is smoky sweet, discreetly brightened by a touch of acidity. As the cup cools, however, the sweetness fades and the smokiness reveals hard, musty undertones. My rating faded too, from a high of 87 to a final landing at 81.",, Sep 1999
86.0,Ethiopia Harrar,"Smoky, resiny tones turn the Harrar fruit richly winy. In the finish everything softens and sweetens. The cabernet fruit tones deepen toward chocolate and the smoke tones turn toward fresh tobacco.",, Sep 1999
94.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"A light, bright breath of acidity shimmers inside an amazing bouquet of sweet jasmine and darker, woodier fragrances. The cup soars in a delicious, reeling dizziness of flowers, then immediately relaxes into spicy shadows. Somehow, all of the range and complexity remains precariously, elegantly in balance.",, Sep 1999
85.0,Mocca Java Blend,"Pungent Sumatra tones wrap around the Ethiopian flowers and Yemen fruit. The deep, aromatic wood tones modulate to a fruity, cherryish chocolate in the finish. The pungency turned slightly flat as the cup cools, slightly shadowing an intriguing and dramatic cup.",, Sep 1999
89.0,Mexican Maya,"Classic vanilla-nut aroma and a solid, authoritatively dry cup, bright but not brassy. Not a lot of nuance, but outstanding range and balance.",, Sep 1999
84.0,Oakhurst Morning,"A pleasant roast-driven pungency balances a sturdy, assertive acidity. Dry and authoritative. Something seems to be flattening nuance, however. Either the five blend components are canceling one another out or the forceful roast has driven out some aromatics. In any event, more sweetness and lift would make a pleasantly hearty Oakhurst morning even rosier.",, Sep 1999
88.0,Ethiopian Yirgacheffe,"The famous Yirgacheffe flower tones are brighter and sturdier than usual here: less levitating, more grounded, fresh but rich, accessible, gently acidy. The cup darkens toward cedar and chocolate in the finish, the aftertaste is long and richly floral.",, Sep 1999
83.0,Don Pedro Supremo,"This complex, fruity, softly intense coffee unleashed a torrent of description from the panel. On aroma: ""sweet cocoa, dried cherries""; ""very strong & fruity."" Descriptions of acidity included sweet, floral, fruity. Body: buttery yet light. Cup: fruity, sweet, ""strong honey notes, very nice, very different."" The odd intensity of this coffee, arresting yet restrained, disturbed two panelists: ""Some may call this coffee pleasingly complex, but I find it a little wild,"" declared one. Count me in the pleasingly complex camp. I loved this coffee.",, Aug 1999
82.0,Café Virgen de Oro,"A promising coffee shadowed by inconsistency. The good cups: sweet, full, deep, but alive with a pleasing shimmer of acidity. The bad: full and sweet but monotoned, flat, with a disturbing hint of astringency in aftertaste.",, Aug 1999
82.0,Tuluni Supremo,"Lots of praise for the fruity nose, but the cup failed to excite and the aftertaste disappointed. Overall, panelists found little to either condemn or admire. I felt the coffee had been cleanly processed but still emerged flat.",, Aug 1999
79.0,"Guatemalan Antigua, 1999",A promising coffee dried out in the roast. The slightly charred bittersweetness edges toward chocolate but doesn't quite make it. Any remaining nuance appears to have been burned off.,, Jul 1999
87.0,Guatemala Huehuetenango ’99,"An exquisitely refined chocolate sensation dominates the profile. The chocolate is at its richest and sweetest in aroma, then turns pleasantly dry in the cup and lingers crisply in aftertaste. This may be a bit of a one-note coffee, but it's a very elegant note.",, Jul 1999
81.0,Antigua Bella Carmona ’99,"The bright Latin-American profile is complicated in the aroma by dry, pungently roasty nut tones. The cup displays unusual vegetal tones that reach toward floral, but fall a bit short.",, Jul 1999
84.0,"Guatemalan El Injerto, 1999","The powerful acidity is like a whack across the palate. It doesn't allow much else to make an impression, although some cups hinted at a nutty sweetness. Perhaps the robust, dominating acidity is pleasure enough.",, Jul 1999
89.0,"Guatemalan Antigua, 1999","A gently bright coffee, sweet and alive with spice and smoke in the aroma and floral innuendo in the cup. The floral tones linger in the aftertaste. Just enough resonance and depth to maintain authority.",, Jul 1999
84.0,"Guatemala Fraijanes, 1999","A rich, rounded acidity dominates with unaffected clarity from aroma through aftertaste. A cup in which nuance is not so much absent as irrelevant to the cup's essential candor.",, Jul 1999
86.0,"Guatemala Antigua, 1998","A classic Latin-American cup, dominated by an austere, powerful, full-throated acidity. The big, acidy profile is both impressive and monolithic, complicated only by barely felt floral tones, a sort of deeply held essence of flowers.",, Jul 1999
93.0,"Guatemala Antigua Organic, 1999","An almost symphonic coffee. Nuance stretches across the profile: floral notes at the top, winy, dry fruit in the middle, and a smoky pungency at bottom. Sweet, cedarish notes tend to dominate in aroma and aftertaste, but in the cup fruit and flowers upstage everything else.",, Jul 1999
80.0,"Guatemala, 1999","The roast dominates the coffee, burning off sugars and turning the cup dryly pungent, full and hearty but not sweet. Crisp chocolate tones complicate the finish.",, Jul 1999
83.0,"Guatemala Atitlan, 1998","A full, rich, low-keyed cup. Stolid but not inert, with just enough acidity vibrating at the heart of the coffee to keep it lively.",, Jul 1999
89.0,"Guatemala, 1998 / 1999","An unusual profile: sweet cedarish tones turn smokily chocolate in the finish. The chocolate sensation is superb: dry yet sweet, crisp and complex, lingering with husky richness in the aftertaste.",, Jul 1999
84.0,Nicaragua Organic,"The roast turns the lemony acidity rich and smokily pungent. Not a lot of range or innuendo, but a balanced and satisfying cup.",Price: NA, Jun 1999
84.0,Jamaican Blue Mtn Dark Roast,"A clean, sweetly understated acidity complicated by a hint of flowers animates the bittersweetness of the dark roast. Ultimately the bitter tones dominate in finish, however, and intensify as the coffee cools.",, Jun 1999
88.0,Kenya,"Rich Kenya wine tones dominate, buoyed by shimmers of citrus and berry. A complex sweetness blooms as the cup cools and the dry wine tones soften. A fine coffee, although I missed the echoing dimension of the very best Kenyas.",, Jun 1999
85.0,Bohemian Blend,"Probably the smoothest, most seamlessly integrated dark-roast blend in the cupping. Preserves distinct acidy tones, but wraps them in dark-roast character, balancing them richly on the cusp between fruity tart and roasty pungent. Softly sweet in finish, without a trace of charred or burned notes.",, Jun 1999
85.0,Best of Africa Blend,"Strikingly sweet, with virtually no dark-roast bitterness. The sweetness is agreeably complicated by tart berryish or citrusy tones, but overall the profile seems a bit restrained, a touch limited in range and dimension.",, Jun 1999
88.0,Turkish Blend,"To my palate, one of the finer dark roasts in the cupping. The sweetness is elegantly complex and lemony, lightly rich, almost juicy. A subdued charred bitterness balances the fruity sweetness.",, Jun 1999
88.0,Kenya,"A deep, resonant pungency envelops the Kenya dry wine and tart berry tones, giving them a sexy fresh-sweat twist. This odd, rough-yet-smooth pungency is a Peet's trade mark, and only occasionally found in coffees dark-roasted by competitors. Here it supports without obliterating the citrus and berry freshness of the Kenya.",, Jun 1999
80.0,French Roast,"As usual with most extreme dark-roasted blends sold under the name French roast, no real flavor survives, only competing sensations of bitter and sweet -- in this case inclined more toward the bitter. I preferred this particular ""French roast"" profile over several others owing to the invigorating intensity of the bittersweetness",, Jun 1999
80.0,Italian Roast,"A fresh citrusy sharpness complicates the dark-roast bittersweetness. The bitter tones intensify in finish, but never completely master the sweetness, which persists pleasantly through aftertaste.",, Jun 1999
80.0,Fogbuster Blend,"A pleasantly charred sweetness, buoyant and almost floral, dominates at first. As the cup cools the sweetness recedes and the bitter side of the dark-roast cup prevails.",, Jun 1999
81.0,French Roast,"The bittersweet paradox is less intense here than in the Jeremiah's Pick French Roast, with a bit more emphasis on the sweet side of the equation and a hint of dry, pruny fruit. The smoothest body of the eight French roasts I cupped, suggesting that the roast drove fewer fats out of the bean.",, Jun 1999
87.0,Jamaica Blue Mtn:Old Tavern #1,"Close to the great Blue Mountains of the past: balanced, round, very rich, almost bouillon-like, with a slight, spicy effervescence tickling at the heart of the cup. Regrettably, a faint, almost undetectable hardness or storage-related fading shadows the otherwise superb cup.",, May 1999
85.0,Kenya Decaf,"Sweet, almost juicy, lemon-and-nut-tones carry exhilaratingly from aroma into the cup. Once there, they turn a bit stolid, then darkens toward tobacco in the finish.",, May 1999
87.0,Moka,"When hot, the cup is light-bodied but smooth, with a touch of levitating floral-toned fruit that turns sweetly chocolate in the finish. As the cup cools the fruit deepens toward wine and even more distinctly chocolate tones.",, May 1999
86.0,Hawaiian Kona Extra Fancy,"A dry, powerful, authoritative cup, rich but not sweet. The ringing energy of the acidity and the substantial body are close to monumental, though lovers of delicacy and nuance may be disappointed.",, May 1999
85.0,Fifth Anniversary Blend,"A blend that in its completeness is a tribute to the blender's art. Solid without drama, displaying excellent range and a fine balance between sweetness and (I would guess) Indonesia pungency. Mouth-filling, close to creamy body, cleanly resounding aftertaste.",, May 1999
90.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"Lovely Yirgacheffe character: Floral, intense, transporting, as astonishing at first sip as the sudden scent of jasmine at dusk. What makes this particular Yirgacheffe an especially fine example of the origin is a touch of richness and power supporting the always remarkable perfumes.",, May 1999
87.0,Yemen Mocha,"A cup displaying all of the idiosyncrasy and complexity that makes Yemen such a fascinating origin. The aroma is funky, rich, pungent, all haloed by sweetness. The body is rich and buttery. The controversial, slightly composty overtones to the fruit that turn some palates off to Yemen are gently dominated here by the pungent taste of the roast, turning the fruit into a sensation as much tactile as olfactory, a sort of smoky, dry-toned richness.",, May 1999
88.0,Kona – Honomalino Extra Fancy,"A more authoritative, richer version of the Honomalino Kona Peaberry. The nose is rounder, the acidity brighter and brisker,the body fuller. The tantalizing tickle of flowers and fruit remains, complicating and elevating the dry acidy notes.",, May 1999
87.0,Kona – Honomalino Peaberry,"Superb aroma: rich, acidy, alive with nut and vanilla overtones. In the cup less range but still pleasingly high-toned: acidy, buoyant, and bright with hints of flowers and fruit.",, May 1999
88.0,Colombian Supremo Popayan,"A distinctively sweet, fruity Colombia. The fruit hovers on the edge of ferment, but to my palate remains safely on the lush but chocolate-cherryish side of the defect divide. The nose is perfectly clean: sweet, light, cocoa-like, the acidity nicely balanced between sweet and dry tones, the body medium to fullish.",, May 1999
84.0,Sumatra Decaf,"Distinct lemony tones elevate the profile of this roundly satisfying but rather light-bodied Sumatra. The finish is lively, theaftertaste long and clean.",, May 1999
88.0,Organic CO2 Decaf Peru,"A coffee that rewards deliberation. The sweet nut tones that are the glory of many softer Latin-America coffees run luxuriantly through the profile from aroma to finish, taking on a distinct chocolate cast in the cup. A coffee whose richness reads more as resonance than heaviness.",, May 1999
91.0,Mocha Java Style Blend,"Sweet, deeply dimensioned floral notes dip toward spice and nut in the aroma. The cup is lemony, but it is a complex, deep lemon, modulating toward dry chocolate in the finish. Saved from any hint of candyish sentiment by richly acidy mid-notes.",, May 1999
88.0,Tchoupitoulas Blend,"A splendid, high-toned cup, soaring but complex. Floral tones whisper at the top of the profile, wine-toned fruit fills out the middle; both float on a base of understated, toasty richness.",, May 1999
85.0,Koloa Estate Dark Roast,"A suavely understated dark roast with a tickle of spice and chocolate at its heart. The pungent bite of the dark roast is muted and enveloped in sweetness, the finish rich and chocolate-toned.",, May 1999
80.0,Aged Sumatra,"Considerably more emphatic and complex than the Armeno aged Sumatra, apparently owing to the handling of the roast. The same hardness characteristic of many aged Sumatras of recent years is enveloped here with a soft, almost candy-like sweetness, modulating to a dry, tobaccoish finish. Sweet notes prevail in the aftertaste.",, Apr 1999
86.0,Java Estate,"Not a trace of the twisty pungency of most Sumatras and Sulawesis here. Instead a nut-softening-to-vanilla nose, a clear, assertive floral-toned acidity, even a hint of smoke in the finish. With just a little more dimension and sweetness this coffee would be a knockout.",, Apr 1999
84.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"A slight pungency immediately melts in cinnamon-tending sweet spice. The solid (though not hard or heavy) profile retains a consistent character from nose through long, resonant aftertaste. The spice simplifies a bit as the cup cools.",, Apr 1999
82.0,Papua New Guinea Sigri,"An unexceptional but comfortable Pacific profile: pungent but not sharp, round, medium-bodied, with a hint of dry, wine-like fruit as the cup cools.",, Apr 1999
81.0,Sumatra Gayo Mountain,"Another juxtaposition of hard-toned pungency and soft sweetness, although here the sweetness blooms with subtle floral notes in finish and aftertaste. Somewhere in the overlap of hardness and sweetness an additional little nuance emerges, a pleasant spicy tickle.",, Apr 1999
81.0,Organic Timor,"A clean Indonesia profile, meaning the pungency is soft rather than oppressively hard and the balancing sweetness is substantial and fresh. An ingratiating and straightforward coffee, though short on nuance.",, Apr 1999
80.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"A hard, baggy pungency. A sweet, soft (perhaps floral) sweetness. When the two work together we get an agreeable sweet/sharp taste that suggests chocolate. The sweet subtext prevails pleasantly in the aftertaste.",, Apr 1999
80.0,Sulawesi Kalossi DP,"Another coffee in which the hard tones characteristic of many traditionally processed Indonesian coffees are precariously mellowed by an ingratiating sweetness. The combination of (perhaps musty) sharpness and sweetness hints at chocolate, particularly in the finish.",, Apr 1999
78.0,Organic Timor,"A hard pungency dominates the profile, but it's a rather rich, deep-throated hardness, with undertones of dry spice and a shimmer of sweetness. Possibly an over-aggressive roast burned off some of the sugars, imbalancing the cup.",, Apr 1999
76.0,Aged Sumatra Mandh. Pawani,"I had difficulty deciding whether to honor the inert hardness of this coffee because it's a deliberately achieved characteristic, or condemn it as a defect because I don't find it a particularly pleasant version of the aged taste. The dominating attribute is an oppressively hard pungency that flattens and simplifies the profile. Only a delicate halo of almost subliminal sweetness lightens the cup.",, Apr 1999
88.0,New Guinea Sigri,"A understated but profoundly complex coffee that rewards patience. The nose is restrained, but in the cup a roundly rich pungency is balanced by pronounced sweetness and nuanced by subtle wine tones. The finish is resonant, the aftertaste long, sweet and clean.",, Apr 1999
87.0,Java,"A powerful sweetness transforms the Indonesia pungency into clear dry chocolate tones, enlivened by a touch of acidy brightness. The chocolate tones hint at spice in finish and aftertaste.",, Apr 1999
82.0,Kenya AA- Green,"Consensus found the acidity in this Kenya pleasantly fruity and sweet in the nose but disturbingly sharp in the cup and astringent in the aftertaste. Again, a slightly darker roast might help tame the sharpness. A few of us found solace in what struck us as a round, rather richly textured body.",, Mar 1999
83.0,Kenya AA – Green,"Pungent, full, deep-throated fruit dominates here. Several panelists called the cup balanced, which I take as praise for the way the acidity animates the profile from the inside rather than screaming off the top. Nevertheless, overall this coffee generated limited enthusiasm. ""Decent,"" wrote one. ""Not the big fruity notes, but drinkable,"" harrumphed another. ""Lacks true East African character,"" complained a third.",, Mar 1999
83.0,Kenya AA – Green,"Ambivalence. Several panelists admired this Keny's understated but richly fruity sweetness, but judging from their scores, remained only mildly impressed by the whole package. ""Sweet undertones; dances nicely on the palate, but with a weird, disjointed rhythm"" wrote one, memorably. ""Thin, lackluster,"" complained another. I found the cup pleasant but underpowered.",, Mar 1999
85.0,Kenya AA – Green,"Bright but well-matrixed acidity, full body, and a complex cluster of grace notes elevated the score of this sample. ""Good balance of flavors, excellent complexity, ... fruit, spice, ... tropical woods, cedar with some sweet dark chocolate. [But] fades when cool. Where did all that flavor go?"" For me the flavor went too soon. I missed length and development, and found the smoky, herby notes a touch dissonant. But that's a minority opinion: Overall the panel very much admired this coffee.",, Mar 1999
88.0,Kenya AA – Green,"A high score but a relatively low wow quotient. Apparently panelists valued this coffee for its rich balance and deeply matrixed fruit; the body was described variously as full, heavy, and thick. However, several panelists felt the cup was a bit faded, restrained, ""past-croppish."" Perhaps this is an instance when the mid-season timing of the cupping did prejudice the cupping results.",, Mar 1999
85.0,Kenya AA – Green,"This was my personal favorite for its explosion of flowers and fruit and long, chocolate-toned finish. I wasn't alone. I counted two ""wows!"" scrawled on the cupping forms, a significant wow-quotient given the usually restrained disposition of the panel. Although most stopped short of wow, they did register their admiration for this coffee's bright, nuanced fruit and balanced matrix. Only one dissenter: ""Bright, lemony cup, ... but I want more body and depth."" Once again, a darker roast might go a long way toward developing that depth.",, Mar 1999
82.0,Kenya AA – Green,"I liked this coffee. For me it displayed the typical strength of fine Kenyas: clean, bright, berry-nuanced fruit and tremendous dimension. Most of the panelists didn't taste it that way. They found the acidity a touch too astringent, particularly in aftertaste. One eloquently sat the fence: ""good berry flavors, a 'juicy' cup, [but] finish a bit astringent. Needs balance."" A darker roast might help achieve that balance by softening the acidity.",, Mar 1999
89.0,Kenya AA – Green,"This Kenya attracted the highest rating achieved by any coffee since Coffee Review began its panel cuppings. Judging from comments alone it would seem that its bright, vibrant acidity powered it to the top, but I suspect that the ultimate reason it prevailed over other samples in the cupping is its deep, echoing dimension. This coffee didn't just tickle or please the palate, it resonated on it like the stroke of a deliciously humming gong. Minority report: Despite the high score, two panelists felt the powerful acidity imbalanced and overly simplified the profile.",, Mar 1999
85.0,Kenya AA – Green,"The brightly assertive, sweetly fruity acidity that Kenya enthusiasts love is on full display here, cradled by a richly textured body. As a bonus we get the treasured Kenya berry notes, although the panel wasn't sure whether they were blueberry, blackberry, strawberry or just ""berry."" Berries and all, I found this otherwise splendid Kenya a touch shallow in dimension compared to the highest-rated Gaturiri.",, Mar 1999
86.0,Kenya AA – Green,"Most panelists found the acidity too dominating here and the rest of the profile too neutral, making for a sort of one-dimensional Kenya cup. ""A test-tube Kenya,"" complained one. ""Very bright acidity, but not able to pick out other threads,"" wrote another. Finally: ""Very citrusy. I'll score it high for acidity, but would like to try a darker roast in hopes [that] more depth and sweetness emerge."" I found the cup pleasant but underpowered.",, Mar 1999
80.0,Zimbabwe – Green,"Ambivalence. Most panelists noted a pleasantly fruity, floral sweetness, particularly in the nose, but as the coffee cooled an underlying baggy flatness emerged to drown out the pleasant memories. ""This coffee is like a bitter wind,"" wrote one. ""Cools to grassy flavors."" Two panelists complained that the roast was too light to do justice to the coffee. Perhaps that accounts for the grassy notes, but I don't think that the overall flatness can be attributed to roast.",, Mar 1999
85.0,Kenya – Muthewathi AA,"Bright but well-matrixed acidity, full body, and a complex cluster of grace notes elevated the score of this sample. ""Good balance of flavors, excellent complexity, ... fruit, spice, ... tropical woods, cedar with some sweet dark chocolate. [But] fades when cool. Where did all that flavor go?"" For me the flavor went too soon. I missed length and development, and found the smoky, herby notes a touch dissonant. But that's a minority opinion: Overall the panel very much admired this coffee.",, Mar 1999
88.0,Kenya – Marua AA,"A high score but a relatively low wow quotient. Apparently panelists valued this coffee for its rich balance and deeply matrixed fruit; the body was described variously as full, heavy, and thick. However, several panelists felt the cup was a bit faded, restrained, ""past-croppish."" Perhaps this is an instance when the mid-season timing of the cupping did prejudice the cupping results.",, Mar 1999
85.0,Kenya – Gatomboya AA,"The brightly assertive, sweetly fruity acidity that Kenya enthusiasts love is on full display here, cradled by a richly textured body. As a bonus we get the treasured Kenya berry notes, although the panel wasn't sure whether they were blueberry, blackberry, strawberry or just ""berry."" Berries and all, I found this otherwise splendid Kenya a touch shallow in dimension compared to the highest-rated Gaturiri.",, Mar 1999
70.0,Zimbabwe – Green,"This coffee provoked an unenviable list of drab adjectives: muddy (the favorite), grassy, neutral, ashy, rubber-like. Four panelists labeled the aftertaste ""baggy,"" a term describing a flat, ropey sensation that usually indicates faulty conditioning or storage. Whatever its origin, the defect here overpowers the coffee.",, Mar 1999
72.0,Green Coffee: Zambia,"One set of palates identified the problem with this Zambia as roughness and harsh acidity. Others, including me, simply read the coffee as underdeveloped. ""Flat and woody ... no pulse"" said one. ""Tired,"" according to another. Perhaps too many half-ripe cherries carried through to the sample, or perhaps the lightish roast failed to do justice to the coffee. Three of us detected smoky or tobaccoish notes, but none found these tart embellishments particularly attractive.",, Mar 1999
79.0,Organic Sumatra,"Assuming classic and earthy are not mutually exclusive terms, this is a classically earthy Sumatra: a round, muted but full earth taste gently dominates the profile. Apparently the earth taste comes from drying the coffee directly on the ground rather than on tarpaulins, the usual practice in Sumatra. Although the earth tones are wonderfully soft, overall the profile suffers from a slight bitterness.",, Feb 1999
85.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"A rather refined profile, lighter and sweeter than most Sumatras, with clean hints of fruit and flowers under the usual Sumatra pungency. Much more expansively buoyant at the top of the profile than the other Sumatras in the cupping.",, Feb 1999
84.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"When the cup was hot I thought I had hit the Sumatra jackpot, something close to the great Sumatras of pre-Starbucks days, when Sumatra was an exotic secret shared by a handful of professionals and enthusiasts. Rich, burgundy-like fullness, gathering under the back edges of the tongue, with just enough acidity to set off dark tickles and echoes. However, a slightly bitter and salty aftertaste gave away this coffee's weakness, which became abundantly clear as the cup cooled: just enough hardness to dampen an otherwise splendid profile.",, Feb 1999
80.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Distinctive but limited. The strength of the cup is a powerfully smoky, carbony center with pleasing hints of dry chocolate. Little sweetness or range, however, making it a bit of a Johnny-one-note (though it's a rather exotic note).",, Feb 1999
79.0,Decaf Sumatra,"The dark roast style develops a subdued sweet-sweat pungency and attractive cedar tones in the aroma, but the cup disappoints. Not so much flat as underpowered: light-bodied, little range or dimension, with the main pleasure a gentle, unassuming bittersweetness.",, Feb 1999
79.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"The roast dominates the coffee here, overlaying the mouth-filling Sumatra richness with distinct carbon tones. The result is a dry, pungently full profile, powerful but a bit to astringent for my taste.",, Feb 1999
78.0,Decaf Sumatra,"Another decaf-ravaged Sumatra: Here the aroma is as subdued as the cup. A touch of carbon from the roast and a bit of sweet tobacco from the Sumatra, but not much else: clean, low-toned, empty.",, Feb 1999
78.0,Sumatra,"Another Sumatra with intrigue, but more murky than mysterious. The aroma is marvelous, alive with vanilla and sweet aromatic wood tones, but the cup settles down into a heavy smokiness unrelieved by lift or sweetness. Hints of dry chocolate turn tobaccoish in the finish.",, Feb 1999
88.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"A solid, bordering-on-classic Sumatra profile: low-toned but rich, pleasantly pruny, its distinct pungency saved from bitterness by a sweetness that grows in power as the coffee cools.",, Feb 1999
77.0,Sumatra Dark Roast,"A clean profile, but a bit flat. No sweetness, no lift, little dimension. Deep but opaque.",, Feb 1999
77.0,Sumatra,"Under the taste of the darkish roast style earthy, but not a sweet or inviting earth. A bit hard (no pun), without depth, bounce or resonance. A tobaccoey, salty tickle in the finish.",, Feb 1999
89.0,Espresso di Carlo,"Clean and elegant aroma with a shimmer of vanilla. In the demitasse complex, exciting, but not entirely balanced. The contrast of pungent sharpness and underlying caramelly sweetness is dramatic but stark, and carries the coffee precariously toward a rich but slightly astringent aftertaste. Blooms beautifully in milk, softening without losing authority and revealing deep, dry, bittersweet chocolate tones.",, Jan 1999
85.0,Organic Blue de Brasil Estate,"An impressive tribute to the tactile dimension of taste: the body is smooth, buttery, alive yet full. The profile is sweet and deeply dimensioned with a pleasantly spicy tickle at its heart, but remains rather limited in range. The aftertaste reveals the merest hint of hardness.",, Jan 1999
84.0,Euro-Espresso Blend,"Crisp and toasty nose. In the demitasse heavy though not sharp; some sweetness but little nuance. The heaviness turns smooth in milk, expanding richly, but even there the cup remains austere and rather monolithic.",, Jan 1999
83.0,HouseQuake2,"Distinct orange-citrus tones are exhilaratingly fresh when the cup is hot, but turn mildly astringent as it cools. The body is round and creamy, but lighter than any of the straight Brazils in the cupping.",, Jan 1999
79.0,Brazil,"For me this coffee lacks sufficient sweetness to support its attractive tobacco, spice and floral notes. Sweetness in dry-processed coffees like this one comes from sustained contact of the bean with ripe fruit during drying. The profile-flattening lack of sweetness here may derive from too many green or unripe cherries in the mix.",, Jan 1999
78.0,Espresso,"Restrained but elegant nose; in the demitasse sharply rich but lacks sweetness. The aftertaste is distinctly astringent. Masters milk nicely, but even in dairy not quite enough sweetness and nuance for my palate.",, Jan 1999
78.0,Brazil FVA Natural Dry,"Either an over-aggressive roast or a drying-related defect in the green coffee deadens a promising profile. Satisfying body and richness, but little sweetness or nuance.",, Jan 1999
78.0,Brazilian,"A dullness, perhaps a shadow defect from rain-interrupted drying, shadows an otherwise splendidly sweet profile. The sweetness, enlivened by spice and chocolate, almost sneaks out from under the hardness at the finish, but never quite makes it. Too bad.",, Jan 1999
73.0,Brazil Bourbon Santos,"Very sharp, carbony cup, with little richness or sweetness. Both aroma and body seem burned off the coffee by the rather aggressive roast. I also tried this coffee as espresso. In the demitasse it remained sharp, but softened and sweetened a bit in milk.",, Jan 1999
70.0,Brazil Fazenda Vista Alegre,"A hard, nasty ferment mars an otherwise sweetly rich profile.",, Jan 1999
87.0,Brazil Bourbon Santos,"Displays a rich, deeply matrixed acidity reminiscent of the best Sumatras. Although the cup is not quite as sweet and roundly ingratiating at first sip as some others in the cupping, the acidity sustains power as the cup cools, hence the somewhat higher rating for this coffee compared to those with comparable sweetness and body. A slight edginess to the acidity may indicate a scattering of cherries that were close to ferment as the coffee dried, but this shadow fault, if present at all, is so faint that it strikes me as a quibble. A fine coffee well-roasted.",, Jan 1999
86.0,Brazil Fancy Bourbon Santos,"Rich with a low-toned, vibrant acidity. The body is creamily smooth, though a touch lighter than the heaviest-bodiedBrazils in the cupping. Here the sweet spice tones characteristic of natural Brazils are buoyant and floral, almost Yirgacheffe-like in their perfumes. The floral tones linger sweetly in the aftertaste.",, Jan 1999
85.0,North Pole Blend,"A solid American-style breakfast profile: Dry and acidy but balanced, complete, closing on rich. Everything is up front, however: limited dimension and development.",, Dec 1998
84.0,Santa’s Choice,A tribute to dark-roast fruit character. In the nose deep with prune and sweet pipe-tobacco tones. In the cup the fruit comes up dry and pungent before softening and sweetening toward the finish.,, Dec 1998
80.0,Decaffeinated Christmas Blend,"A clean, direct dark-roast profile. The dominant pungency is free of carbon and dances rather lightly on the palate, with some spicy overtones and space for them to echo.",, Dec 1998
80.0,Celebration Caffe,"Another holiday coffee distinguished by a dark-roasted, pungent heart. The pungency dominates, but reads as rich and resilient, and is complicated by an unusual taste tickle. I want to call it cedar, but a publicist might call it spice. It's a pleasant holiday-themed sensation.",, Dec 1998
79.0,Estate Reserve Typica,"A very comfortable, low-key cup. The dark-roast pungency is pronounced but easy-going. Just enough richness to satisfy. Not much nuance but some sweet echoes.",, Dec 1998
79.0,Holiday Blend,"A compromise coffee between dark and medium roast, pleasantly low-key, but not much range or dimension.",, Dec 1998
73.0,Santa’s Blend,"Dominated by a dry, unforgiving pungency. The center of the coffee has little resilience or shimmer. A touch of hard, rubbery taste surfaces in the finish. I have to assume that something went wrong with the roast.",, Dec 1998
83.0,"Estate Reserve Peaberry, 1997","Considerable dry-chocolate intrigue behind the dark-roast pungency. The aroma is extraordinary: light and buoyant with sweet vanilla-chocolate notes and a hint of nut. Settles down in the cup, where the pungency turns the chocolate tones pleasantly dry and smoky.",, Dec 1998
78.0,Christmas Blend,"A wonderful nose, full of bittersweet chocolate and deep vanilla tones, but disappointing in the cup: a clean, dry, but rather hard pungency bullies nuance into submission. A hint of carbon, little sweetness.",, Dec 1998
78.0,Reindeer Blend,"A stark pungency dominates: Sweet and rich in the nose, but hardens uncomfortably in the cup, where the sharpness is softened by the barest hint of shadow sweetness. Suggestions of nut in the aroma and dry fruit in the cup barely escape from under the hand of the roast.",, Dec 1998
93.0,Kona Mountain Estate,"An elegant, extraordinary tribute to the pleasures of the sensation coffee people call acidity. Here the acidity is robustly dry yet alive with a full, fragrant sweetness. Everything dances and rings in this coffee.",, Dec 1998
89.0,Nicaraguan Segovia Organic,"Extraordinary aroma: powerfully sweet, enveloping and complex, with tremendous dimension. Almost as impressive in the cup: Full-toned acidity softened by peach or prune, resonant and richly dimensioned, with a sweet, full, almost sugary finish complicated by hints of dry chocolate or tobacco.",, Nov 1998
85.0,Organic Dominican Republic,"Alive with dry nuance and surprise: pruny fruit, crisp chocolate, sweetening slightly toward the finish. As the cup cools the chocolate sharpens a bit toward tobacco and herb. Long, richly dry aftertaste.",, Nov 1998
84.0,Guatemala Pure Organic,"A complex, shifty profile. When the cup is hot, explicit vanilla tones with a hovering suggestion of spice are balanced by a deep-toned, rather pungent tartness. As the cup cools the vanilla sweetens toward caramel and the spice turns vaguely fruity. Perhaps all of the spice and pungency adds up to the famous ""smokiness"" often attributed to Guatemalas.",, Nov 1998
82.0,Nicaragua Segovia,"A solid, no-frills Latin-America acidity dominates the cup. No fruit and very little nuance, although the profile sweetens pleasantly in the finish, rounding toward caramel and perhaps chocolate.",, Nov 1998
81.0,New Guinea Certified Organic,"The earthy flavor dominates the profile. Fortunately, the earth tones are pleasingly sweet and fresh, with just enough herby pungency to complicate rather than distract. The sweetness intensifies toward the finish. The hardness that sometimes sits on the profiles of back-yard-processed coffees like these is barely detectable here.",, Nov 1998
81.0,Costa Rica Lomas al Rio,"Ingratiating and open, this coffee makes the most of what it brings to the cup. Not bright but gently lively, nicely balanced between sweet and dry tones, with a pleasant supporting resonance. As the cup cools a slight, almost indistinguishable (storage-related?) hardness seems to shadow the sweetness.",, Nov 1998
80.0,Organic Blue de Brazil Estate,"Judged on aroma alone, this coffee easily would top the ratings. Intense, deeply dimensioned nut tones soar with an exhilarating sweetness. In the cup, however, things quiet down quickly. A heavy, low-toned acidity dominates a profile complicated by interesting spicy and smoky notes, but without much lift or dimension.",, Nov 1998
79.0,Organic Sumatran Reserve,"The center of the profile is satisfyingly round and full but rather opaque, without lift or brightness. The lone complication is a hint of pungent, pruny fruitiness that turns slightly hard as the cup cools. The impassive profile reveals nuance only as it fades rather richly in the aftertaste.",, Nov 1998
78.0,Costa Rican Poás Volcano,"The coffee is buried under the taste of the roast. To the roastmaster's credit, however, this is no thin, carbony super-dark roast. It displays a pungent heaviness, flirting with bitter, softened at the edges by an almost subliminal sweetness. The sweetness intensifies somewhat in the finish, pushing the pungency toward chocolate. It never quite gets there, however.",, Nov 1998
88.0,Mexico Organic,"Extraordinary aroma: Nothing dramatic, but that may be the point here. Balanced and gently complex. Crisp dry tones keep the levitating sweetness grounded. Hints of smoke in the finish sweeten toward chocolate in the aftertaste.",Price: NA, Nov 1998
85.0,Costa Rica,"Floral, fruity tones dominate, modulating to a sweet spiciness in the finish. The fruit reasserts itself in the long aftertaste. The fruitiness flirts with the over-the-top lush taste called ferment, but to my palate remains on the fresh, pleasing side of the fruit-ferment line.",, Oct 1998
85.0,Costa Rican Viennese,"A natural, vanilla-toned sweetness distinguishes a low-key but lively profile. Nut and spice notes complicate the vanilla sweetness in the aroma, but by finish and aftertaste the vanilla gently (and pleasingly) dominates. Little range or dimension; the vanilla is the main act.",, Oct 1998
89.0,Guatemala Finca Bella Carmona,"An unusually light-bodied, high-toned Guatemala, distinguished by a clean, bright acidity and sweet flowers in the finish. A hint of sweet spice or perhaps chocolate-toned fruitiness resonates under the flowers.",, Oct 1998
86.0,Black Cat Blend,"Restrained, low-toned, rather full-bodied, but not flat. In fact, alive with understated nuance: some tobacco tones, a full, dry spice impression that could be called chocolate; perhaps a hint of fruit or wine in the round finish. The aftertaste leaves a balanced memory of chocolate sweetness and dry tobacco.",, Oct 1998
84.0,Guatemala La Flor del Cafe,"The acidity is light and bright with a shimmer of fruit. At the center of the profile a slight pungency is nuanced by dry wine tones. Not much range, but solid dimension and outstanding balance.",, Oct 1998
84.0,Kenya AA,"The winy acidity characteristic of Kenyas here is pungent and deep, without a trace of fruit or shimmer of berry. It is possible the coffee has faded a bit in storage. Still, a powerful coffee that offers an interesting twist to the Kenya theme.",, Oct 1998
79.0,Blue Ribbon Blend,"It is interesting. The solid, rather simple profile is centered on a deep, mouth-filling, pungent richness. Buried in the pungency is an odd but not unpleasant note that I don't quite remember tasting in coffee: a sort of dry saltiness.",, Oct 1998
92.0,Kenya Nyaithee AA,"It is a measure of this coffee's complexity that every time I returned to the cup it provoked new adjectives. Winy (the favorite), pungent and smoky, vanilla overtones, and in the finish sweetness, prune and chocolate. The body is rather full for a Kenya, and the cup almost shockingly rich. Like all great Kenyas this one keeps shifting and building complexity from first impression through aftertaste.",, Oct 1998
91.0,Kenya AA,"Floral, berry-like, high-toned and vivacious, this striking coffee displays less winy authority than many Kenyas but greater charm. Light-bodied but not light-weight: gives us a sort of levitating richness.",, Sep 1998
91.0,Bayview Farms Kona Extra Fancy,"Complete and classic. Dry and acidy, but the acidity is held inside a deep, resonant matrix and complicated by richly wine-tinged fruit tones. Sweetens exquisitely in the finish. The medium body is smooth and buttery.",, Sep 1998
89.0,Mocha Java Blend,"An extraordinarily clean, elegant Mocha-Java. The contribution of the two Ethiopian coffees is brightly fruity, floral and exhilaratingly fresh. The Java mostly stays out of the way, contributing a slight pungency to balance the Ethiopias' high-toned sweetness. The light body could be taken as a fault, but I found it more exhilaratingly weightless than disappointingly thin.",, Sep 1998
89.0,Yemen Mocha Mattari,"Distinct fruity chocolate tones, cherryish and round, are balanced by a tobaccoey dryness. When the coffee is hot the chocolate-fruit tones are fresh, complex, and thrilling. As the cup cools the tobacco tones intensify and turn slightly (though cleanly) astringent.",, Sep 1998
88.0,Guatemala Coban,"The superb oxymoron of this coffee, powerfully sweet yet sharply pungent, is at its best in aroma and in finish, when the pungent tones soften to a distinct and pleasing spice. Rich, clean aftertaste; medium to light body.",Price: NA, Sep 1998
86.0,Nantucket Blend,"This delightfully gentle coffee is soft, brightly (and lightly) acidy, slightly floral. The aftertaste is as clean as white clapboard, with a lovely vanilla/floral burst, then a memory of pure sweetness. Not much power or depth here, but with a coffee this chastely bright and sweet who cares.",, Sep 1998
86.0,Costa Rica Doka Estate,"A fresh, clean, delightfully natural sweetness is balanced by a drier but still fruity pungency. A fine and distinctive coffee, though memorable more for what it gives out front than what it insinuates. The profile is immediate and pleasing rather than deep.",, Sep 1998
84.0,French Roast,"A fine example of the French-roast archetype. The carbon notes, as integral to French roasts as smoky notes are to Scotch whiskey, are discreet. The main taste complex here is sweet vanilla, floating above a dry, light pungency. Carbon notes prevail in the aftertaste, though a persistent low-toned sweetness gives them a run.",, Sep 1998
87.0,Harvest Dixie Gold Decaf,"A gentle cup that seduces rather than imposes. Saved from the ordinary by a soft, rounded complexity and impressive dimension. Warmly pungent tones, faintly tobaccoish or herby, soften toward chocolate in the finish.",, Sep 1998
89.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"The floral perfumes are high-toned and exquisite in the aroma and overwhelmingly fragrant in the cup. Eventually a sweet, bright-toned coffee emerges from behind all the flowers. Owing to the floral lift the body reads as lightly buoyant rather than thin.",, Sep 1998
86.0,Bremen Decaf No. 907,"The dry, bright sensation called acidity dominates both nose and cup here. It is a pure acidity, without fruity complication or sweet reservation: clean and abstract. Acidity energizes a profile with plenty of sensation in mid range, but with little at the top and only a hint of pruny underpinning.",, Sep 1998
91.0,Owner’s Reserve,"Plenty of nuance and long, complex development. An authoritative, dry-spice pungency opens in a matrix of shadow sweetness. A touch of vanilla in the finish, dry chocolate in the aftertaste. As the cup cools the spice softens and sweetens deliciously.",, Sep 1998
86.0,Portside Blend,"Aromatic and gently complex. Delicate, sweet-vanilla nose. In the demitasse smooth, balanced body and well-nuanced flavor, with pungent chocolate modulating to sweet chocolate in the finish. Slight fruit flourishes. Tends to fade in milk, but retains a light, pleasingly fruity chocolate character.",, Jul 1998
85.0,Skye’s Mountain Blend Decaf,"Not nearly as dramatic as the Olympic mountains, but satisfying and substantial. Straightforward, low-toned, agreeably balanced, vibrant and solid in mid-range, fresh and sweet in finish, complicated by a touch of intrigue that could be called chocolate. As the cup cools the sweet tones grow rounder, fuller and more distinctly chocolate.",Price: NA, Jul 1998
80.0,Monsooned Malabar,"Pungent chocolate in the nose. Slightly sharp in the cup, with distinct tobacco notes and a hint of dry chocolate. Solid body but little resonance.",, Jul 1998
87.0,Guatemala – Finca Dos Marias,"A quietly dramatic coffee with a long development, in which a clear if understated acidity gives way to a sudden sweet lift in the cup, and nutty, pungent (perhaps smoky) notes are balanced by vanilla sweetness. All of the complex gestures remain in balance, and a silky smoothness envelops even the potentially sharp pungency.",, Jul 1998
75.0,AA – Green,"A straightforward coffee, nicely balanced, clean and free of taint except (perhaps) a slight grassiness, a shadow note possibly encouraged by the rather light roast. Panelists noted nutty tones in the aroma and a hint of chocolate in the finish (""cocoa-like"" specified one). Why wasn't this fundamentally centered, pleasant coffee not rated higher? Only one panelist registered enthusiasm. I suspect a lack of what some call power and I call dimension -- the sense of unnamed, resonant sensation opening behind the initial impression.",, Jul 1998
80.0,Jamaica Blue Mountain #1’s – Green,"Reactions to this coffee ranged from enthusiasm to mild approval to ambivalence. The enthusiasts and mild approvers both tended to cite gently bright acidity, full body, and nut-toned aromatics. The enthusiasts felt the coffee brought power to the cup (""packs a punch""), while the approvers felt it didn't (""mild, mild, mild; sweet and soft cup""). The ambivalencers also honored the virtues of the coffee, but detected a slight shadow taint. One suggested that the sample was a bit ""faded,"" another ""baggy."" Both adjectives suggest this otherwise meticulously clean coffee suffered very mild damage, perhaps moisture-related, during transport or storage.",, Jul 1998
74.0,Jamaica Blue Mountain – Green,"The most thoughtful assessments of this coffee characterized it as a potentially powerful but flawed coffee. ""Although a little bit grassy, maybe due to lack of 'reposo' [resting the coffee after processing], this is a very good coffee,"" concluded one panelist. ""Interesting undomesticated flavors,"" offered another. ""One of those coffees that makes me scratch my head and say 'You're different, but do I really want to know you better?'"" On the upside panelists cited this coffee's sweet fruit and richness. On the downside it elicited terms like weedy, oniony, or soapy. The most comprehensive attempt at describing the off-taste cited ""Aromas of dried onions, grains and soy-sauce.""",, Jul 1998
75.0,Jamaica High Mountain – Green,"Another coffee whose assessment was dominated by roast issues. In this case, seven of eight panelists objected that the sample was roasted a bit too light. However, this complaint was offered as an aside to generally approving appraisals of the coffee itself. A general picture emerges of a well-prepared, clean coffee, sweet and balanced, with hints of fruit and nut. ""Aroma of Spanish peanuts carries through to the flavor,"" concluded one panelist. ""Pleasantly focused cup."" Given the tone of approval in written comments, I can only assume that this coffee was not rated higher because it lacked power and dimension.",, Jul 1998
76.0,Haiti – Green,"Although this is not quite the deep, almost syrupy sweet Haitian coffee I recall occasionally tasting before Haiti's latest run of political misfortunes, it is a good coffee, and a very promising one, given the relative newness of the admirable Cafeieres Natives project. On the upside, sweet, ingratiating aromatics. Three panelists called these high, delicate notes floral; three others mentioned cocoa or chocolate; one mint. The more tactile aspects of the cup disturbed some, however. Two used the word ""gritty""; one ""muddy."" I found the cup (with patience) rich, but opaque and without dimension or resonance.",, Jul 1998
76.0,Dominican Republic – Green,"I found this coffee quite impressive when hot, with the sort of resonant dimension and long, gradually sweetening development I admire. However, for me the profile turned a bit grassy and hard as it cooled. The rest of the panel didn't have much to say about this coffee one way or the other. A few complaints surfaced suggesting roughness or hardness; one panelist reported ""good intensity/balance, [though] not enough intensity for my taste."" It would appear that a lack of character rather than taint or weakness doomed this coffee to a relatively low rating.",, Jul 1998
77.0,Dominican Republic – Green,"Something was slightly off with this coffee. Two panelists mentioned ferment but I doubt it. One called the taint grassy; ""slightly harsh & earthy"" wrote another; I had it as ""a touch of hard tobacco, herb."" Whatever it was, it brought down the rating of this otherwise ingratiatingly sweet, rounded coffee with subtle grace notes variously described as chocolate, vanilla, and (the favorite) caramel.",, Jul 1998
68.0,Dominican Republic – Green,"The majority of panelists dismissed this coffee as fermented, the flavor defect that results from the some of the beans picking up the rotten-fruit taste of fermenting sugars during processing or drying. ""Trying to be constructive here but can't find any grounds for redemption,"" wrote one. However, three panelists were open to redemption, rating this coffee in the low 80s, perhaps reading the ferment tones as fruity or wine-like. Two of the three yea-sayers struggled with their ambivalence in their comments, finally coming down on the positive side of the fruit/ferment continuum. The matrix of sensation under and around the ferment definitely was full and complex.",, Jul 1998
78.0,Green Coffee,"This coffee manifested some brightness and acidity in the cup, which probably accounted for a higher rating than one would expect given that several panelists complained of a background shadow or taint. I called the problem a ""slight, high, hard fruitiness."" Another cupper identified it as grassiness; another detected a ""rubbery"" taste; still another concluded the coffee was ""faded."" Not much consensus in those descriptions, but clearly something was off. Two of us noted that the profile tended to vary from cup to cup, with some cups bright with a floral or fruit-toned acidity, and some dulled by the elusive taint.",, Jul 1998
87.0,Bella Vista Tres Rios,"Liveliest and most resonant of the dark-roast samples in the cupping: Less overbearingly pungent, sweeter, with a touch of vanilla in cup as well as aroma. The entire profile deepens, smooths, and balances in the finish.",, Jun 1998
86.0,Costa Rican,"Whether deriving from the unorthodox roasting style or the coffee itself, a spicy pungency weaves its way through this rather soft, medium-bodied profile. At moments this flavor complex suggests chocolate, at others the earthy tones associated with some Indonesian coffees, at others a dark fruitiness-just-short-of-ferment. In the context of the overall sweet, intriguing, broad range of this coffee I tolerated this taste, even liked it, though purists may find it distracting.",, Jun 1998
85.0,Costa Rica Tres Rios,"Pleasant though restrained aroma; outstanding cup. The acidity is floral, levitating, fresh, with the floral notes sweetening and carrying into the heart of the coffee. Pleasant nuance in the upper registers and a solid bottom with suggestions of richness. Medium body.",, Jun 1998
84.0,Costa Rican La Minita,"Balanced, refined, exquisitely complete, though a bit underpowered. Mild pungent tones are softened and rounded by sweetness. Clean yet resonant straight through to aftertaste.",, Jun 1998
83.0,Costa Rica Juan Vinas,"Impressive because, unlike many of the coffees in the cupping, it displays some acidy brightness. May not generate enough sweetness to round the acidity, however, leaving the cup just a touch on the sour side. Not much nuance but solid body.",, Jun 1998
82.0,"Costa Rica, La Amistad","Like so many coffees in the cupping, solid overall but short on sweetness and nuance. In this case, splendidly rich, broad-ranged aroma, decent acidity with a hint of fruit, but generally pungent and rather opaque, with only a touch of sweetness in the finish. A trace of the vanilla-toned richness that dominated in aroma re-emerges in the aftertaste.",, Jun 1998
81.0,Costa Rican Tarrazu,"A low-toned sweetness balances a discreet acidity. Full body, rich spiciness in the cup. The vanilla-nut tones in the aroma resurface fleetingly in the aftertaste. Unfortunately, an additional odd taste also surfaces, particularly when the coffee is cold. This taste, perhaps a mild processing taint, lowered my rating of this otherwise excellent sample.",, Jun 1998
81.0,Costa Rican Tarrazu,"The exhilarating vanilla-nut tones in the aroma together with the heavy, buttery body are the main pleasures here. Otherwise the profile is solid to the point of stolidity. The acidity is pleasant but lacks nuance, the flavor a bit monolithic, and the aftertaste clean but simple.",, Jun 1998
80.0,Costa Rican Tarrazu,"Pleasantly full, rich, low-toned, complete in the bottom registers. Ambiguous grace notes, however: They read as earthy when the coffee is hot, but turn hard and mildly unpleasant as the cup cools. Probably a storage fault. Still, a coffee with power and dimension.",, Jun 1998
79.0,Costa Rican,"Like so many of the coffees in this cupping, a splendid overture in the aroma (nut, vanilla, caramel), then disappointment. A slightly hard, full-bodied but monotonal cup which softens and sweetens only in the finish.",, Jun 1998
79.0,Costa Rica,"The slightly carbony cup seems more heavy than rich until the finish, when a deep-toned, pruny sweetness prevails, enlivened by a touch of spice or sandalwood. Things turn heavy again and a bit astringent in the aftertaste. Complex aroma, solid, buttery body.",, Jun 1998
78.0,Costa Rica,"The aroma sweetens the dark-roast pungency with a singing hint of vanilla, but the pungent character bluntly prevails in the cup. Relatively free of carbon, but not enough sweetness to balance the pungency. For the patient a pruny softness emerges in the finish.",, Jun 1998
78.0,Costa Rican Tarrazu,"Fine vanilla-nut nose and substantial body; otherwise a coffee without much lift, nuance, or development. Muted acidity, with only a sort of pruny pungency to complicate the cup.",, Jun 1998
90.0,Costa Rica – La Minita Tarrazu,"Complex, enveloping, spacious, echoing with subtle, unnameable tones and innuendoes. The acidity is solidly wrapped in sweetness and body. Surprising chocolate tones emerge as the cup cools. The aftertaste is lasting and seductively complex.",, Jun 1998
87.0,Caffe del Sol,"In the demitasse this blend is complexly crisp and pungent; richly dry chocolate notes are supported by an understated sweetness. Perhaps the heavy, smoothly balanced body accounts for the splendid impact this coffee makes in milk. The dairy relaxes the crisp chocolate notes and the coffee richly suffuses the milk rather than penetrating it.",, May 1998
80.0,Espresso á Sante,"This smooth, understated blend displays an impressive variety of nuance throughout its development, from elusive vanilla-nut tones in the mild aroma through smoky and spicy notes in the cup to a touch of fruit or chocolate in aftertaste. In milk the profile is clean, sweet and balanced.",, May 1998
79.0,Fazenda Vista Alegre,"For an espresso this coffee is relatively light-roasted, allowing cup characteristics of the green coffee to emerge in the demitasse. The vanilla-nut tones characteristic of many Brazil dry-processed coffees weave pleasantly through the profile, appearing with particular clarity in aroma and aftertaste. Unfortunately, the herby, earthy sharpness of some dry-processed Brazils also surfaces, especially in the aftertaste. All earthy peccadilloes disappear in milk, however. The sharp, earthy tones mute, the nut tones bloom, and the entire profile relaxes and turns sweet yet forceful.",, May 1998
79.0,Malabar Gold,"The elegant, sweetly complex nose of this coffee translates disappointingly to the cup, where sharp, rough tones distract from the lingering traces of spice and fruit. The aftertaste is long but rather astringent. Handles milk with authority but without much resonance or complexity. The robustas in the blend contribute a very dense, fine-textured crema in the straight shot.",, May 1998
79.0,Italian Roast Espresso,"The dry, dark-roast pungency avoids burned or excessively bitter tones. The pleasantly smoky bite displays a touch of sweetness in the finish and the aftertaste is comfortably free of astringency. In milk rich and balanced.",, May 1998
78.0,Espresso Blend,"A clean, simple pop across the palate. No carbon, not sharp, but not much sweetness or nuance either. Nut tones surface in the finish. My tasting partner was more specific: peanuts. Delivers a straightforward, clean cup in milk, neither particularly sweet nor pungent. A generous assessment would call this profile balanced and forceful; a critical one might accuse it of simplicity and overstatement.",, May 1998
77.0,Espresso Roast,"For me this rather dark-roasted blend's smoky pungency displayed pleasantly fruity tones in the demitasse, and remained (if precariously) on the soft side of bitter. I particularly liked this blend in milk: The pungency carried nicely through the dairy, broadening and softening without losing itself. My tasting partner didn't agree, and found the dark-roast profile a touch carbony in the demitasse and thin in milk.",, May 1998
76.0,Novacella Decaf,"Only a touch of sweetness survives to balance the sharp tones of a very dark roast, but the sharpness is complicated (perhaps rounded) by chocolaty, pruny tones. The aroma is crisp, alive, even elegant, but the profile tends to simplify in the cup and trail off into dimensionless astringency in the aftertaste. At best medium body. Turns sweet and smooth in milk but remains underpowered.",, May 1998
90.0,Perugia Blend,"Levitating with sweetness, clean, complete, balanced, powerful yet elegant, this blend displays tremendous development and dimension. By development I mean the profile transforms in subtle modulations from aroma through aftertaste -- in this case from chocolate and toast notes in aroma and cup to sweet spice tones in finish. Dimension means sensations resonate and expand in nose and on palate rather than standing pat at first impression. In milk this blend remains pleasantly nutty-sweet and complete, but surrenders the complexity and intensity it displayed in the demitasse.",, May 1998
71.0,Espresso Blend,"Virtually all sweetness has been driven out of the coffee by the roast: distinct burned tones in the aroma give way to a hard, smoky pungency in the cup and a rather astringent aftertaste. Milk rounds out and sweetens the pungency, though even here the sharp, hard tones prevail.",, May 1998
79.0,Kona – Green,"The first of four Konas with identical scores of 79 and very similar flavor profiles. Overall assessments of this sample ranged from bland on the downside to balanced on the upside. Which side of the bland/balanced divide panelists settled on probably depended on their predispositions in regard to the Kona profile generally. Three panelists, including me, detected subtle but pleasant wine tones. Three called the acidity sweet, which I assume was praise as well as description. No taints or defects cited; consensus on body: medium.",, Apr 1998
76.0,Yellow Caturra – Green,"An interesting coffee that provoked a wide range of reaction. Everyone agreed that it was a soft coffee with medium body. The controversy centered on the flavor complex at the heart of the profile, which elicited characterizations ranging from ""delightfully spicy"" and ""richly chocolaty"" to ""harsh, burned and disturbing"" and ""burned seaweed, or something I had in a sushi bar(!)."" Scores also varied wildly. The nays didn't outnumber the yeas, but the naysayers nayed with more conviction than the yeasayers yeaed, culminating in a low average score. Readers who like low-acid profiles may want to try this coffee anyhow. At a moderately dark brown or full-city roast I suspect the controversial flavor complex will lose its slightly hard edge and turn definitively complex and rich.",, Apr 1998
79.0,Kona – Green,"Majority opinion: Nutty or lightly herbal in the nose, with an acidity both bright and sweet, medium body, flavor nuanced with tones variously described as chocolaty, spicy, or nutty, and a fresh aftertaste. In other words, a classic Kona with dry rather than fruity nuance. One dissenting panelist described the flavor as tinny, and several others ho-hummed their way through the cup without comment. I was impressed by this coffee, particularly by its sweet nuance and what I call dimension -- the way it opened up in repeated little waves of sensation rather than making its statement and standing pat.",, Apr 1998
80.0,Organic Kona – Green,"This medium-bodied, fruit-toned coffee attracted strong support from several panelists, who apparently admired its solid acidity, balanced, low-key intensity and fruity nuances. Two panelists detected a faint hardness or bagginess in the aftertaste, although both assigned the coffee respectable scores anyhow.",, Apr 1998
84.0,Kona – Green,"The clear winner in this cupping, as it was in the 1997 Kona Coffee Cultural Festival Cupping Competition. The reason: it clearly transcends the pleasantly mellow limits of the classic Kona profile. It displayed power, complexity, and an uncompromising, authoritative acidity, laid right on top of the usual soft, brightly sweet virtues of a typical Kona. Even the Kona-bashers on the panel liked this coffee. (Well, all but one.) Nobody raved, but there were lots of approving noises: ""excellent,"" ""very interesting, very clean on the palate,"" ""nice depth."" However, this excellent coffee might be too authoritative for those who like to slip into the softness of a more typical Kona. Lovers of Kona's sweeter, gentler side may prefer one of the less acidy profiles like the Guyer, Hamasaki, or Bayview Farms mill selections. The rather powerful acidity of this coffee casts doubt on the specialty coffee truism that only high growing altitudes (usually defined as over 4,000 feet) can produce solidly acidy coffees. The average elevation of the Fitzgerald Estate is around 1,600 feet. Apparently microclimate can mimic the conditions that, at higher altitudes, produce acidy profiles.",, Apr 1998
81.0,Kona Extra Fancy – Green,"The Kona song is the same, but this coffee sang it a little stronger and cleaner. No taints or weaknesses whatsoever were cited for this sample. Characterizations of overall flavor, which with the somewhat lower-rated Konas tended to be evenly divided between naysaying ""bland"" and yeasaying ""balanced,"" here clearly settled on balanced. Occasional little pleasured exclamations turned up on the cupping forms: ""very enjoyable""; ""the nutty characteristics remained in the cup from beginning to end.""",, Apr 1998
79.0,Green Coffee: Kona,"Several panelists described distinct wine tones, which seemed to be the main nuance that separated this Kona from the others clustered in the middle of the cupping. Otherwise, the familiar Kona profile emerges: bright yet gentle acidity, medium body, balanced flavor, clean aftertaste. Although one panelist felt the coffee generally left a ""thin"" impression, no taints or weaknesses were cited. In fact, the words ""clean"" and ""fresh"" each came up four times in respect to aftertaste.",, Apr 1998
93.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Not entirely typical for a Sumatra, but something of a revelation: an almost Latin-American brightness up front before the deep Sumatra tones prevail, pulling us down into a broad, deep, sweet vanilla-tinged center. An amazing range, from the fleeting floral top notes to a pungently rich bottom, plus a long, satisfying development that carries straight through to the vanilla memories in the aftertaste.",, Mar 1998
87.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Another solid, heavy-centered Sumatra. Here, however, the dark center reveals hints of wine and a character more complexly pungent than sweet. The pungency is free of earthy or hard notes, and reads as the very quintessence of rich.",, Mar 1998
84.0,Sumatra Lintong Zamrud,"An understated sweet liveliness lifts the rather stolid heart of this coffee. I can't cite any grace notes, simply a very pleasant, sweet lift. Good dimension, but (for a Sumatra) a rather shallow bottom.",, Mar 1998
82.0,Sumatra Blue Lintong “Yiayia”,"Low-toned, full-bodied, absolutely solid at the center (maybe too), with slight hints of fruit and sweetness at the edges. In other words, a typical Sumatra. Would be a classic Sumatra if there were something more going on inside that center or a little more shimmer or lift around those edges. As it is, substantial, satisfying, but a touch inert.",, Mar 1998
81.0,Dark Sumatra,"The dark roast style leans toward carbon here but remains on the flavorful side of it, turning the Sumatra richness pungent and darkening the sweet tones with hints of what a publicist might call chocolate. If this coffee had showed some development I would have rated it higher, but the profile made its statement and stood pat from there. As with the other Café d'Alma coffees in the cupping, I suspect a loss of aromatics in shipping.",, Mar 1998
81.0,Organic Sumatran Reserve,"Another typically full-bodied, solid-centered Sumatra. Not much range or complexity, but good development: If you stay with the coffee the heaviness at the center seems to grow in weight and power, revealing reticent pruny, sweet-pungent tones in the finish. As it cools, the herby, earthy tones characteristic of some Sumatras emerge, carrying (perhaps) a hint of hardness. Without that hint I would have rated this Sumatra higher.",, Mar 1998
80.0,Sumatra,"Another Sumatra carried to a dark roast with enough tact to avoid carbon. But, alas, not enought to save the sweetness and nuance. What's left is a balanced dry heaviness that can be read as richness.",, Mar 1998
80.0,Organic Sumatra,"Herbal, pungent tones, a bit too sharp for earthy, dominate the profile, reverberating in its characteristically solid Sumatra heart. Only a touch of sweet nuance, but the herbal tones are intriguing. They turn slightly hard as the coffee cools.",, Mar 1998
80.0,Sumatra,"A darkish roast style asserts itself here, turning the heavy Sumatra center distinctly pungent. A slight sweetness emerges in the finish, but the mildly astringent pungency dominates in the aftertaste. A vibrant aliveness in the center of this coffee is its most attractive feature.",, Mar 1998
80.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"An interesting but atypical Sumatra profile: Distinctly, almost distractingly sweet vanilla tones float over the Sumatra depth, which you only sense through a kind of echo. Perfumy, at turns suggesting flowers and then nuts, the vanilla notes may be too intense for elegance, lingering straight into the aftertaste, where they turn slightly cloying.",, Mar 1998
78.0,Organic Sumatran,"Another heavy-centered Sumatra, this one with hints of sweetness and vanilla all but buried under an herby, earthy character. The earthiness is rough but rather pleasant, with only the barest hint of hardness.",, Mar 1998
78.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"Still another solid, deep Sumatra, but lacking range or dimension. Clean, one-dimensional, with little resonance in the heart of the coffee or shimmer around the edges. The aromatics seemed a bit tired; perhaps the problem here is a loss of aromatics in shipping.",, Mar 1998
77.0,Brazil Washed – Green,"We couldn't make up our collective mind about this wet-processed coffee. I found it light and pleasantly bright -- appropriate to a good wet-processed coffee from lower altitudes. Several agreed, finding the acidity fruity and sweet. Others, however, reacted critically to the delicate profile: ""Washed ... blah!"" exclaimed one. Assessments of body were surprisingly varied, ranging from thin to buttery and full. Finally, two reviewers found flat-out fault with the profile: ""dirty,"" complained one; ""baggy"" (flat, ropey taste), accused the other.",, Feb 1998
80.0,Natural – Green,"Although this quietly elegant Brazil didn't attract the sort of raves the highest-rated Guatemala elicited in our July 1997 cupping, it did stimulate admiring comment and the highest rating in the cupping. ""Excellent overall. Stands by itself as an estate coffee."" ""This coffee is the best of the lot."" Admiration centered on a smoothly substantial body and a deeply nuanced flavor. Three reviewers identified the grace notes as chocolate, a term that came up only occasionally with other coffees. One even qualified chocolate by category: ""bittersweet chocolate, not sweet!"" .",, Feb 1998
76.0,Washed – Green,"""Yes! This is a coffee for non-believers. This sample will convert the pagans,"" wrote one reviewer, apparently a supporter of Brazil coffees. Well, most of the pagans stayed unconverted, still groveling about before their acidy Central-American idols. The usual vanilla and nut tones were noted approvingly in the aroma, the soft sweetness of the acidity observed, but little enthusiasm emerged in the categories of body, flavor or aftertaste. ""Not much depth,"" complained one. ""Very uniform throughout the range in all taste aspects,"" remarked another carefully, ""not lacking anything in particular, yet not exceeding in any category either."" Three reviewers noted mild faults, two with a forest products theme: ""papery; wet cardboard,"" said one; ""woody"" complained the other.",, Feb 1998
77.0,Natural – Green,"Although this dry-processed coffee scored roughly the same as the three preceding samples, reviewers' comments seemed to indicate a coffee with more character and development. No faults or weaknesses were noted, and a tone of quiet respect ran through the few comments on flavor and aftertaste: ""smooth - mellow""; ""very pleasing."" A split vote on body: about half the reviewers who commented found it heavy, and about half thin or light.",, Feb 1998
75.0,Green,"""Clean, monolithic,"" one cupper wrote. ""OK but same old same,"" wrote another. One of four coffees in the cupping for which no faults whatsoever were cited; on the other hand, this carefully prepared coffee elicited only mild praise. The acidity was predictably characterized as ""soft"" (five of ten reviewers). Words like sweet and caramelly popped up occasionally. Only one reviewer actually effused: ""chocolaty and sweet; nutty flavor.""",, Feb 1998
73.0,Green Coffee,"Perhaps this coffee was betrayed by our sample roasting. Four of ten reviewers mentioned burned or smoky tastes that may have been owing to a rushed or overdeveloped roast. Two identified a fault that may be associated with the coffee and not the roast -- a slightly medicinal or harsh character. No grace notes were cited, although the term ""soft"" came up frequently as usual. I was definitely in the minority with this coffee: I felt it required patience, but developed nicely: ""At first heavy but nondescript, but then a gentle, light, levitating sweetness dances off the top,"" I wrote.",, Feb 1998
73.0,Green Coffee,"It wasn't entirely clear whether it was a thin, attenuated quality that put this semi-dry-processed coffee near the bottom of the cupping (three reviewers explicitly used the word ""thin""), or an off-taste too subtle to be called a defect but unpleasant nonetheless. I called it a ""baggy hardness""; three other panelists also used the word ""hard"" to describe it; others used close synonyms like harsh and bitter. On the positive side, several praised this coffee's sweetness.",, Feb 1998
88.0,Yuletide Mocha-Java Decaf,"Everything happens in the higher registers here, and a lot does. A wonderful, dry/sweet complex, almost effervescent, lifts the heart of this light, bright coffee. An amazing range of grace notes shimmer in the higher registers: dry chocolate, herb, even a suggestion of vanilla in the finish. I had to strain to find a hint of Red Sea gaminess amid all the aromatic action; it may have shown up in the long, subtly complex aftertaste. Hard to believe so much complexity made it through the decaffeination process. Perhaps a good Yemen coffee is so intense that the muting effect of decaffeination actually helps by mellowing it a bit.",, Jan 1998
86.0,Mocca-Java,"One of the most successful Mocha-Javas in the cupping, this one opens with a shiver of rank Red Sea wildness, which almost immediately gives way to a swelling, lyrical fruitiness that persists sweetly and richly through the high-toned finish. A hint of the rankness resurfaces in the aftertaste. The pleasure here is almost entirely in the complex top of the profile; the bottom is a bit weak and underpowered.",, Jan 1998
78.0,Mocha Java Blend,"A rather rough ride. The first impression is complex, but not entirely pleasantly so: a hard, ropey sensation sits on the profile. Behind and around the hard center a bracing, fruity richness opens, but we never get completely out from under the hardness, which, among other things, seems to depress the sweetness in the fruit.",, Jan 1998
84.0,Mocha-Java Style,"Clean and decisive profile, but a bit too much wallop and not quite enough tickle. Little sweetness or nuance. Some dimension, but a rather hard, winy (not fruity) acidity dominates, sitting on the rest of the profile.",, Jan 1998
82.0,Mocha-Java Private Reserve,"The strength of this excellent Mocha-Java is in the full, rich body and complex bottom. The low notes remain alive, complicating and deepening through the finish. Not much lift or sweetness at the top, however. The only grace notes I detected were a touch of carbon and some heavy pruniness.",, Jan 1998
79.0,Arabian Mocha Java,"A rather complex dark-roast cup. Clear carbon, but the roast was conducted with enough deliberation to preserve some richness and a touch of sweetness. The most engaging complication was in the dry center of the profile: a pruny, complex pungency that read as chocolate in the aroma. The carbon reasserted itself in the aftertaste.",, Jan 1998
79.0,"Mocha Java, Harrar Style",A clean but slightly oppressive hardness or astringency dampens the fruity Mocha-Java richness. A touch of carbon. The background fruitiness pleasantly hints at chocolate in the finish.,, Jan 1998
79.0,Mocha-Java Blend,"Not much in the way of grace notes or fruit, but a very full body and an impressive range and dimension. The finish is rich and deep-toned. Only a trace of Red-Sea wildness from the Yemen.",, Jan 1998
78.0,Mocha-Java Style,"Once again, a rather flat astringency, a sort of strident monotone, dominates the center of the profile, abetted in this case by a touch of carbony sharpness. Some fruit and sweetness, though the grace notes tend toward the tobacco and herb.",Price: NA, Jan 1998
72.0,Royal Mocha-Java,"This coffee was roasted so darkly and probably at such high temperatures that little was left to taste except overwhelming carbon plus a hint of high, singing sweetness that emerged in aroma and finish. The green coffee the roastmaster started with may well have been excellent, but the roast certainly wasn't.",, Jan 1998
86.0,Royal Vinter Kaffe,"An exceptionally luxuriant cup, from the deep, vibrant bottom to the lush but muted acidity. I particularly admire this coffee's dimension, the way it continues to develop in waves of gentle revelation from aroma through finish. The problem: as the coffee cools the fruit tones turn slightly overripe and gamey. The positive fruit and complexity come from the same place as the suspect gaminess, of course: One of the blend components is probably a small-grower, hand-processed coffee, probably either an Indonesia Sulawesi or Ethiopia.",, Dec 1997
83.0,Gourmet’s Choice,"Solid from top to bottom. The power in the lower ranges is particularly impressive for a coffee brought to a medium roast. Don't look for tickle, inspiration or sweetness, however. The grace notes, if any, tend toward herb or tobacco.",, Dec 1997
82.0,Reindeer Blend,"Rich, round, complete. The aroma in particular displayed an impressive range, from sweet nut tones through a dark pungency. This pleasing bittersweet balance prevailed through to finish. A good example of a coffee brought to a darkish roast style tactfully enough to avoid carbon while maintaining sweetness. Little discernible acidity, but enough to keep the profile from going flat.",, Dec 1997
82.0,"Kenya AA, Grand Cru 1997","The exhilaratingly bright, complexly winy acidity turns slightly hard and herbal as it settles on the palate, limiting the vivacity of the first impression. As the coffee cools the profile relaxes, allowing some rich sweetness to emerge behind the acidity.",, Dec 1997
80.0,Celebration Caffe,"No carbon and lots of sweetness here, smoothing and rounding the dark-roast pungency. A pleasing smokiness turns sweet and ambiguously chocolate in the aftertaste.",, Dec 1997
80.0,Holiday Blend,"A solid, balanced dark-roast profile. A hint of wine-toned acidity, perhaps even some wildness, teases from inside the fundamental dark-roast bittersweetness. Some carbon, but overall good range and structure.",, Dec 1997
80.0,Holiday Blend,"Hints of carbon mar an otherwise expansive profile: Sweet, light nuance at the top with a touch of wine in the acidity; suggestions of dark-roast pungency near the bottom. The complexity fades and carbon dominates in the aftertaste.",, Dec 1997
79.0,Marrakesh Blend,"A dark-roast on the dry side. Preserves some of the bright, acidy tones of lighter roasts, balancing them with prune and tobacco in the mid ranges. No carbon, but not much sweetness either. Good range from top to middle of the profile, but short on depth and dimension.",, Dec 1997
78.0,Christmas Blend,"The elements of the dark-roast complex -- sweetness, pungency and carbon -- all work together smoothly here until the aftertaste, when carbon tones linger past any memory of sweetness. Until that moment, this coffee achieves an unassuming dark-roast completeness.",, Dec 1997
78.0,Mexico Maragogipe,"Bean-size aside, everything in this coffee walks the middle, from the subdued vanilla-nut complex in the aroma, through the clear but unemphatic acidity in the cup, to the clean aftertaste. Unfortunately, no resonance at the bottom of the profile, no shimmers at the top, no development in the finish. Satisfying but limited.",, Dec 1997
77.0,Hawaiian Christmas Roast,"Dominated by a pruny, rather heavy pungency at the heart of the profile, livened by only a faint shimmer of acidity. Not quite enough sweetness to balance the pungency or acidity to brighten it. The grace notes tend toward the dry and herbal.",, Dec 1997
76.0,Patshatl Blend,"Solid, full-bodied dark-roast cup. Carbon tones dominate the sweet side of the dark-roast equation, and only the hints of prune and chocolate relieve the ultimately rather austere profile.",, Dec 1997
88.0,Shaded Decaf Mexican,"A tribute to dimension and balance. A complete, classic coffee; medium-bodied, with a discreetly wine-toned acidity and just a touch of darker-roasted pungency. Even displays a hint of carbon in the finish, which I could do without, but which some may take as a sign of completeness.",, Nov 1997
87.0,"Song Bird, Costa Rican","A superbly balanced coffee, with a low-toned, slightly winy acidity, a touch of vanilla in the nose, and a solid, dark-roast bottom with little in the way of carbony distraction.",, Nov 1997
87.0,Colombia Huila Supremo,"This one keeps coming; vistas of completeness unfold in small, repeated waves of exhilarating revelation. The profile is built around a deep-toned version of the classic vanilla-nut-toned flavor complex. Sufficient acidity; not strikingly sweet but sweet enough.",, Nov 1997
84.0,Costa Rican Miravalles,"This coffee could be condemned for its lack of power or admired for its soft refinement and vanilla- and nut-toned sweetness. I bought in on the sweetness side. The vanilla-nut tones displayed remarkable persistence, complicating the aroma and lingering in the aftertaste with surprisingly clarity and richness.",, Nov 1997
84.0,Organic Papua New Guinea,"High, wild, winy notes rip through this coffee, first thrilling us, then turning uncomfortably lush in the finish, finally leveling out in a relatively clean aftertaste. American coffee culture hasn't made up its mind about this overripe, edge-of-compost taste. Is it a strange and wonderful gift of nature to be treasured, like the carefully cultivated mold in certain cheeses? Or do we dismiss it as a symptom of poorly-handled coffee?",, Nov 1997
82.0,Organic Guatemalan,"Some attractive grace notes teased their way through the balanced, unassuming profile. I read them as herbal in my notes on aroma and chocolate when I got to the cup. Either way they're on the low-toned, pungent side of the taste ledger rather than the high and sweet.",, Nov 1997
81.0,Nicaraguan Maragogipe,A complete but rather simple profile; decent acidity balances the pungency of the moderately dark roast. Hints of vanilla intensify and the entire profile sweetens as the coffee cools.,, Nov 1997
81.0,New Guinea Nectar,"My rating for this coffee rose steadily as it cooled. At first the profile seemed pleasant yet inert, without lift or innuendo. But as I came back to it the coffee seemed to elevate, lighten and sweeten, and in the end the combination of substantial body and unassuming sweetness won me over.",, Nov 1997
81.0,Guatemalan Santiago Atitlan,"The aroma was curiously flat, the body ordinary, but the acidity splendid: powerful without shrillness, complex, alive with muted wine tones. Smoky hints in the cup turned slightly hard and tobacco-like in the finish, but softened again in the rich aftertaste. .",, Nov 1997
79.0,Guatemala Atitlan,"A sweet nuttiness dominates here, startling in its clarity. This taste complex, typically a bit player in coffees, takes extravagant control of this one, upstaging everything else. True, a hint of wine made itself heard above the sweetness of the acidity. Perhaps some slightly hard, metallic or tobacco tones flitted across the stage just as the lights went down.",, Nov 1997
79.0,Organic Peruvian Select,"I found this coffee's profile interesting but rather odd. It displayed a heavy, dull-yet-rich quality, reminiscent of some Indonesian and East-Indian coffees, plus a distinct earth taste. Literally earth; this coffee is neither dirty in the general sense nor earthy in the romantic sense; rather, the cup simply tastes a bit like dirt. There are other intrigues as well: delicate vanilla-toned high notes shimmer atop the aroma and dark prune-tobacco tones emerge in the finish. Despite all of the olfactory action I still wouldn't call this coffee complex, since everything seems controlled by a rather stolid inertia at the center of the profile.",, Nov 1997
78.0,Mexican Stewardship Coffee,A substantial coffee without much in the way of surprise or intrigue. Odd smoky or pruny tones surfaced in the aroma and finish. Displayed enough acidity to avoid flatness but not enough to excite. The absence of sweetness and nuance in the upper ranges more than anything else relegated this coffee to the agreeably ordinary.,, Nov 1997
72.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"""Distinct fruity, pruny carbon tones; not much else,"" I wrote the first time I cupped this coffee. I used almost the same words the second time around. Simply not enough going on here. The carbon is not the thin, burned-out sensation of overdone French roasts, by the way. More the taste of very dark toast with a memory of marmalade.",, Nov 1997
80.0,Nicaraguan Segovia,"The high point was the dazzling aroma, full of heady vanilla tones shimmering over a rich pungency. Subsequently, things went downhill. A hardness emerged in the aftertaste, and as the coffee cooled the entire profile stiffened and lost its sweetness. Perhaps the coffee was not sturdy enough to sustain its aromatics in the moderately dark roast style.",, Nov 1997
82.0,Qualita Oro,"Italians, it is said, don't care for the acidity, the bright, dry sensation valued in American drip coffees. Ironically, this blended-in-Italy coffee displays more acidy notes than any other in the tasting. The dry, fruity notes enliven and lift the typically rounded Espresso profile. The roast adds smoky, spicy notes that dance on the edge of carbon without committing.",, Oct 1997
81.0,Dancing Goats Blend,"Simple but centered, a classically solid Espresso. Once past the low-key, caramel/toast/chocolate nose I didn't register much in the way of grace notes, but neither was I oppressed by carbon. My taster colleague picked up muted wine-fruit tones. In milk, sweet and substantial.",Price: NA, Oct 1997
80.0,New Moon Espresso,"I found this blend low-toned and pungently fruity, although the fruitiness was dry rather than sweet. For me the pungency turned pleasantly round, sweet, and chocolaty when combined with milk. My tasting colleague didn't respond to the pungency in any context. She found this blend too sharp in a demitasse and too thin in milk.",, Oct 1997
79.0,Espresso Dolce,"Another dark-roast blend in which the sweet-chocolate-vanilla complex barely makes it out from under the carbon. But it does, and a muted vanilla sweetness lifts the profile in the finish. Milk, as usual, smooths the carbon and glorifies the sweetness.",, Oct 1997
78.0,Major Dickason’s Blend,"Not much fruit here and lots of rather twisty, smoky carbon. But if you're patient the sweet-pungent Espresso complex emerges behind the carbon, with perhaps a hint of chocolate. The carbon flattens the profile in the finish, but the body is husky and the entire package improves in milk, which as usual ramps up the sweetness and exaggerates the chocolate.",, Oct 1997
77.0,"Espresso Blend, So. Italian","The aromatics of the vanilla-chocolate complex fade fast under the impact of the carbon, although the clean-sweat pungency will please lovers of extremely dark roasts. The blanketing astringency of the carbon reaches a climax in the aftertaste, but even there sweetness balances and pungency complicates.",, Oct 1997
77.0,Espresso Blend,"A carbony bite suggests this blend may have been roasted too quickly. Otherwise a very agreeable, rather straightforward Espresso, with solid body and a satisfying balance of sweet and pungent tones. The profile fades rather quickly in the finish, perhaps owing to a rushed roast that burned off aromatics.",, Oct 1997
77.0,Illy Espresso,"The elegant fruit and toast tones in the aroma fade quickly, leaving a surprisingly hard, astringent profile behind, free of carbon but equally empty of acidy or grace notes, displaying more tactile than aromatic power. The profile sweetens and rounds in milk.",, Oct 1997
75.0,Vesuvio Blend,"This remarkably light, self-effacing blend displays no acidity and no bitterness. Only the slightest carbon astringency surfaces in the aftertaste. Unfortunately, this tribute to subtlety doesn't display much power or complexity either -- only an evanescent caramel-chocolate sweetness, which loses its way almost completely in milk.",Price: NA, Oct 1997
90.0,Napoli Blend,"The clear winner in the tasting, perhaps because it showed pungent dark-roast character without losing sweetness or complexity to carbon. Distinct chocolate notes, good dimension, substantial body, smooth balance of bitter and sweet tones, although the bitterness does get the upper hand in the aftertaste. Fills out nicely in milk without losing authority or complexity.",, Oct 1997
86.0,Perugia Blend,"A distinct bouquet of floral and fruit notes enlivens and complicates the chocolate-vanilla Espresso sweetness while freshening and brightening the aftertaste. Altogether a rather remarkable Espresso: sweet, fragrant, and virtually without carbon or bitterness. Fades a bit in milk.",, Oct 1997
77.0,El Salvador – Green,"Sweet-nuanced words like nutty, fruity and caramelly dominated reports on this coffee. ""Interesting combination of aspects,"" said one. I found the acidity a bit hard behind the fruit tones, but almost no one else complained. One cupper alone found a defect: one slightly dirty cup out of (presumably) three.",, Sep 1997
71.0,El Salvador – Green,"Most of the wallflower coffees near the bottom of the rankings managed to seduce at least one or two of the Cupping Board with their soft sweetness. I fell for this one. I found it light but pleasingly subtle and complex in the upper registers. I wasn't completely alone: ""nice, mild coffee""; ""smooth""; ""nutty, caramelly."" But a majority found little interest to offset the light body: ""common""; ""not very exciting""; ""crispy but boring."" Furthermore, three found the acidity a little edgy (""a touch sour""; ""harsh""; ""raw""). Another reported a yeastiness in one of three cups. I understand the characterization of this coffee as common but not the complaints about the acidity. Perhaps this is another case of variation among individual samples.",, Sep 1997
74.0,El Salvador – Green,"A familiar story: Some like this coffee's soft expansiveness, others found the profile boring. In the affirmative: ""wide-bodied and mellow""; in the negative: ""dull, lifeless."" Four cuppers picked up chocolate notes. The subtle acidity also attracted both support (""bright and fruity""; ""brisk"") and criticism (""some unpleasant astringency""). My particular sample displayed a marked difference among three cups, with one exhibiting a flat hardness that betrayed the overall sweetness and depth of the other two.",, Sep 1997
73.0,El Salvador – Green,"Almost everyone remarked on the paradox of an acidity that read as complex and fruit-toned, yet oddly hard. ""Very good taste but not refined, bright and brassy""; ""winy but flat""; ""sharp yet sweet""; and most succinct: ""fruity sour."" Several remarked on the perfumes in the aroma and top notes, variously characterizing them as fruity, floral, and winy.",, Sep 1997
79.0,El Salvador – Green,"Although the overall rating earned by this coffee was the same as the rating for the preceding Larin pacamara, the comments were less effusive. No exclamation points, and the poker-faced praise-word ""nice"" came up twice: ""nice berry (raspberry) tang""; ""sweet nice but fuzzy."" In the comments the body of this coffee was admired more consistently than any other in the cupping: ""full""; ""buttery."" The absence of off-notes, the sweetly fruity acidity, and the fullish body together seem to have lifted this coffee to the top of the cupping.",, Sep 1997
71.0,El Salvador – Green,"Two contributors admired this coffee for its soft sweetness. Everyone else found it commonplace: ""A bit flat, though pleasant and inoffensive""; ""Okay, nondescript."" The most outspoken condemnation: ""Flat, dusty, institutional."" Curiously, although most cuppers found the taste flat, several cited piquant nuances: herbal, spicy, etc. Perhaps the piquancy suggests the potential of this coffee and the flatness is a weakness caused by rushed fermentation or errors in handling or storage. Support for the latter hypothesis comes from one very specific assessment: ""Slightly musty in the cup.""",, Sep 1997
79.0,Pacamara El 98 – Green,"One of the two clear winners in the cupping, this coffee's delicate, sweet top notes and complex aromatics attracted a bouquet of admiring adjectives, including caramelly (the favorite), floral and fruity. ""Good blackberry flavor and aroma with complex floral overtones."" ""Best coffee of the bunch. Very close to outstanding."" One admirer felt let down after the aroma, however. First: ""Wow! Tangy, floral grace notes."" Then: ""Not quite as exciting in cup as in nose.""",, Sep 1997
76.0,Bourbon – Green,"Blind assessment:I found considerable intrigue in this coffee: subtle grace notes and substantial dimension in the upper registers. Only one cupper fully agreed with me, however: ""Very interesting coffee."" Another admired the cup but took it for granted: ""Acceptable standard for Central American cup, nothing to write home about."" I would have given this sample my highest score if I hadn't detected something off in one cup. I had company here too: Another panelist encountered one off-cup of three which he characterized as ""sour,"" while another noted something ""grassy, twisty"" in the aroma. For me the problem was a suspicious lushness in the acidity.",, Sep 1997
75.0,El Salvador – Green,"Few complaints here, but not much enthusiasm either. At least no one called this coffee ordinary or boring. ""Excellent coffee,"" said one, ""although repeated cuppings left me with a feeling of 'something lacking.'"" ""Doesn't go anywhere,"" I observed. However, one of the cuppers felt this coffee came ""back with a second level of depth; a good, full cup."" Perhaps the rest of us weren't patient enough.",, Sep 1997
68.0,El Salvador – Green,"A decent coffee ruined by a probably avoidable defect. Parts of the bag from which our samples came apparently picked up moisture during storage. Some individual samples (perhaps from the top part of the bag) cupped cleanly and sweetly, but most displayed either a rope-like taste called baggy (cited by five cuppers) or the moldy-basement taste called musty (two cuppers), both defects typically caused by post-processing moisture. Inspection of this coffee revealed more visual defects than displayed by any of the Itzalco coffees in the cupping, which may indicate something additional went wrong before the coffee went into the bag.",, Sep 1997
76.0,Green Coffee,"Blind assessment:Scores were solid with almost no complaints, but again, not much was offered in the way of enthusiasm or praise. ""Great blender,"" said one, which led me to think about the difference between a great blender and a good blender. A great blender, it would seem, is a coffee that decisively strengthens or empowers other coffees without imposing itself, like a dinner guest who doesn't have much to say but makes everyone else at the table wittier and more graceful. Perhaps a ""good"" blender, on the other hand, just sits around amiably without causing problems. Be that as it may, I'm not sure everyone would agree with the ""great"" adjective either. Two panelists found something a little hard or suspect in the acidity. Only one mentioned a defect, Don Schoenholt, who in a charming and inspired outburst of cupper self-parody wrote: ""Slightly soapy aftertaste note sure if it was Dove or Ivory unscented in one of three cups.""",, Sep 1997
84.0,Decaffeinated Kenya AA,"A rather distinctive coffee marked by a clear, winy acidity that some would call bright and others sharp. I lean toward bright with rough edges. The acidity is so dominating that I had a difficult time reading the body: I finally concluded medium. And the broken record rasps: intriguing first impression but not much behind it.",, Aug 1997
84.0,Decaf Colombian Supremo,"Solid, balanced, with a slightly winy acidity wrapped in a substantial body, all characteristics of a good Colombia. But again, these virtues seem attenuated. The complexity is confined to the middle registers, with both top and bottom notes pinched off. A slight sweetness fills out the profile in the finish.",, Aug 1997
83.0,Decaffeinated Kenya,"The acidity is powerful yet subdued, slightly (and properly, given the origin) winy. Not much depth or resonance, but a nutty sweetness emerges in the finish that surprises, given the origin. The roast contributes some slight carbon tones.",, Aug 1997
80.0,Decaffeinated French Roast,"One of the few coffees in the cupping with resonance and depth. You have to be patient with this coffee and wait for the heavy, pruny, dark-roast pungency to reveal itself in the finish, but it's worth the wait. If this coffee showed some acidity and top notes it might be a real winner. As it is, the attic is bare and all the fun is in the cellar, but that's probably as it should be in something called a French roast.",, Aug 1997
79.0,Decaffeinated Natural Sidamo,"An unusual coffee, probably owing to the dry processing. The aroma is deep, rich, and powerful; the body full. In the cup, however, the power turns rather hard and herbal, almost peppery. Like so many coffees in the cupping, this one promises depth, yet won't let us past a hardness at the bottom of the profile.",, Aug 1997
78.0,Decaffeinated Colombian,"Another coffee with a pleasing first impression. The acidity is deep, fruity, perhaps winy. But there's no cushion or bounce here, and little intrigue beyond the fruity acidity and a touch of carbon. The hard simplicity carries into the aftertaste, although the profile rounds a bit as the coffee cools.",, Aug 1997
73.0,Decaffeinated Costa Rican,"The roast overwhelms the coffee here. The cup is carbon-toned and rather thin-bodied, with little nuance or dimension. Pleasant and without offense, but this Costa Rica's virtues and surprises apparently were left behind in the decaffeination vat and roasting smoke.",, Aug 1997
83.0,Decaffeinated Sumatra Mandh.,"Little acidity and not much at the top, but balanced and complete in the middle ranges. Rich, particularly in the nose, although the rich impression doesn't develop beyond the first impression, and tends to fade in the finish.",, Aug 1997
83.0,Decaffeinated Sumatra Mandh.,"A sweet-toned acidity, a sort of subdued brightness, enlivens this medium-bodied coffee. The sweetness reads with considerable complexity: as vanilla in the nose and fruit-toned chocolate in the cup. Once these nuances have pleased us, however, nothing further turns up. No depth, no teasing secrets. Still, the elegantly complex top notes make this coffee one of the standouts in the cupping.",, Aug 1997
81.0,Decaffeinated Guatemala,"The acidity is pronounced, although more fruity and sweet than dry and brisk. Distinct chocolate tones nuance the fruit. The chocolate turns darkly prune-like in the finish, and lingers sweetly in the aftertaste. An attractive and ingratiating coffee, although the rather heavy body remains curiously inert under all the sweetness.",, Aug 1997
76.0,Green,"This delicate coffee is the inverse of the San Rafael. Its virtues would seem to be softness, lightness, and buoyant top notes. Its weakness appears to be lack of power, and its faults failures of youth rather than age. Several cuppers detected floral tones. Others tasted notes ranging from spicy through herbal to nutty (the favorite, noted on three forms). Nevertheless, several cuppers were put off by shortcomings associated with immaturity: grassiness, rawness. Two detected sour notes.",, Jul 1997
78.0,Green,"Virtually everyone described this medium-bodied coffee as soft and sweet. About half of the cuppers reported nutty tones. Some stopped there. ""Unremarkable!"" exclaimed one. Several, however, also identified a light, high-toned acidity that balanced or complemented the sweetness. For example: ""Pleasant soft, sweet acidity -- subtly snappy."" Two cuppers detected slightly hard or woody notes in the nose of this coffee, but apparently tasted nothing to confirm the problem in the cup and chose not to push the issue in their responses.",, Jul 1997
71.0,Green,"Defects apparently consigned this rather heavy-bodied, low-toned Antigua to the bottom of the cupping-form pile. Some found its low-toned heaviness flat; others, however, liked it. Several called the profile ""sweet""; another ""solid."" One cupper raved: ""Great cup. Very good body and flavor."" Another puzzled: ""Aspects don't gel, even though it has good flavor."" Three cuppers detected sour notes, one going so far as to call the coffee ""oniony."" Three others found it old-tasting or ""baggy,"" which suggests conditioning or storage problems, a plausible hypothesis for a coffee that suggests power but doesn't come through, that seems oddly dulled or muted.",, Jul 1997
76.0,Green,"Most found this Antigua a bit underpowered, perhaps owing to its relatively light body (noted by almost everyone). Some found compensating virtues: chocolaty, spicy, nutty notes. Others praised a soft, sweet smoothness. Still others objected: ""a bit lifeless""; ""not so happening""; ""thin""; and most Originsal, ""straightlaced[!]"". Only two found outright failings: a slight sourness. One delivered an inspired characterization of the subtle fragrance: ""Dancing on fruity.""",, Jul 1997
79.0,Green,"For most the acidity was the main act here. Some found it pleasantly bright (""nice, winy and sharp,"" according to one); others complained it was too sharp, throwing off the balance of the coffee, and perhaps astringent in the aftertaste. Supporting virtue: Most found this coffee substantial in body. ""An excellent example of a Guatemala,"" according to one. But judging from the scores, the majority may harbor reservations.",, Jul 1997
80.0,Green,"A provocative coffee. Everyone had something to say about it, yet no clear consensus emerged. The majority read the body as full (""even and full; well-balanced,"" according to one), but a small but outspoken minority found it light or even thin. Surprisingly, almost no one came down in the middle. Reactions to acidity were similarly mixed: Several found the acidity pleasantly dry and winy; others criticized it as sharp or sour. I found it alive and vivacious at first impression but rather ragged and astringent in the finish. No defects were cited; on the other hand nobody carried on about grace notes either.",, Jul 1997
78.0,Green,"Judging by the scores, I was in the minority here. I loved this Antigua for its dimension and completeness -- the way it resonated on the palate and developed, stretching into the distance behind the initial impression. Some cuppers agreed: ""nice complexity ... clean, lingering aftertaste""; ""full [bodied], great structure."" But others wanted more out front: ""all the right characteristics, but very [much] in the distance, blurry."" Four detected chocolate notes; only one found a mild off note.",, Jul 1997
77.0,Green,"A powerful but flawed coffee. Coffee professionals are familiar with the taste of ferment, caused when the sugars from the coffee fruit begin to go off while the fruit is still on the bean. The result is an odd, lush sensation that can register as ripe, overripe, or occasionally (particularly as the coffee cools) rotten. Cupper's comments reflect the ambivalence that mild ferment provokes. Almost everyone noted this coffee's luxuriant, wine-like fruitiness. Six cuppers detected a clear defect, however, and five of the six identified the defect (correctly in my view) as ferment, the shadow side of the fruitiness. Only one cupper dismissed the coffee on the basis of this defect, however, and in compensation several noted spicy nuances.",, Jul 1997
79.0,Green,"Almost everyone remarked on a complex sweetness in this medium-bodied Huehuetenango. Some characterized the sweetness as chocolate-toned; others as caramel. Two assigned the sensations to that tantalizing cusp between chocolate and fruit. Most found the acidity sufficient to enliven the sweetness (""bright, pleasant, intriguing""), but one cupper complained that the acidity was disappointing and another that it was ""puckery."" There was an unusually wide range of response to body. Assessments ranged from light to (emphatically) heavy, with a consensus somewhere between medium and full. Perhaps our palates were confused by the pervasive sweetness, which can read as weight.",, Jul 1997
79.0,Traditional Premium Roast,"The aroma is complete but fades quickly. The acidity is bright, clear, and classic, hovering on the edge of winy. Some resonance echoes under the acidity, but both pleasure and complexity are concentrated at the top of the profile.",, May 1997
89.0,Breakfast Blend,Herbal tones in the aroma turn spicy and fruity in the cup. The fruit nuances in the acidity lift the top of the profile and keep it light and shimmering all the way through to finish and aftertaste. Enough bottom for resonance.,, May 1997
82.0,MJB Hawaiian Blend,"For a canned coffee, considerable aroma: full, complete, with a silky, slightly vanilla-toned sweetness that grows in power as the coffee cools. Enough acidity to keep the coffee from dying, and a solid if obvious bottom.",, May 1997
77.0,Folger Mountain Grown Coffee,"The aroma is slight but lively; the acidity is bright, classic and lightly assertive, remaining safely if precariously on the right side of sour. The bottom notes provide just enough ballast for the relatively buoyant acidity.",, May 1997
74.0,Folgers French Roast,"A somewhat darker-than-supermarket-norm roast style helps mute acidity and sweeten the profile. Virtually no top notes, but a smooth, sweet-toned bottom with an attractive pruny finish.",, May 1997
73.0,Moka Java,"Superb aroma: full, rich, stretching from winy top notes to a deep, engaging bottom. But the wine-like East African acidity turns hard in the cup, then reveals clear fermented notes as the coffee cools. The Java component is weak, failing to provide the expansive bottom such blends call for.",, May 1997
71.0,100% Colombian,A deep bottom with just enough acidity to keep from the coffee from imploding into dullness. Other than the rather full body I read few signs of the Colombia profile in this decent but hardly exciting coffee.,, May 1997
71.0,Hills Bros. Coffee,"A sweet nuttiness dominates here, without offense but also without much intrigue or energy. The nut-like tones may harbor a hint of acidity but no grace notes and little depth or dimension.",, May 1997
70.0,Colombian Supremo,"For a moment, somewhere between nose and finish, this coffee struck me as rich with its nut and vanilla tones. But overall a thin-toned acidity dominates: an edgy, almost sour distraction without grace notes or resonance.",, May 1997
68.0,Lady Lee Coffee,"The vanilla / nut tones in the aroma fade quickly in the cup, giving way to a rather hard, characterless acidity that eventually takes on prune-like inflections in the finish.",, May 1997
65.0,Maxwell House Master Blend,"Low-toned to the point of flatness. A hard, slightly metallic taste is the only sign of acidity. A sweet sensation that reads as vanilla in the nose and prune in the finish is the only saving virtue.",, May 1997
60.0,Original Bean Coffee,"Fermented notes, barely detectable in the acidy notes of the aroma, dominate in the cup, particularly as the coffee cools, turning from mild distraction to barnyard nasty.",, May 1997
90.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"I wouldn't have expected a coffee so subtle to stand up to a dark roast so well. The roast only slightly mutes the heady floral tones of the aroma, while the acidity in tantalizing Yirgacheffe fashion hovers between flower and fruit. The body is hardly robust, but substantial enough to support the top notes. Only a trace of carbon.",, Apr 1997
90.0,"Aged Sumatra Mandh., Pawani","Spicy, perhaps smoky tones enliven the rich top notes of the aroma and carry into the cup. Surprisingly clear acidity, fine body, long finish, superb aftertaste.",, Apr 1997
89.0,Guatemala Antigua,"This rich, deeply dimensioned, complex version of the great Guatemala profile happily combines clear, wine-toned acidity with satisfying dark-roast pungency. I even detected a hint of the famous Antigua smokiness smoldering somewhere inside the pungency.",, Apr 1997
86.0,Sumatra Mandheling,"A model Mandheling: Low-toned, heavy-bodied, balanced, mouth-filling. Some carbon, but buffered by depth and richness. Enough acidity makes it through the roast to keep the deep bottom of the coffee from sagging into boredom.",, Apr 1997
85.0,Gumanch,"Some winy notes flirt from inside the dark-roast pungency. Otherwise an unremarkable but solid dark-roast coffee: balanced, without sharpness, and nearly carbon-free.",, Apr 1997
84.0,Sulawesi,"Extends from a deep, rich bottom to acidy, wine-elevated notes at the top. The usual Starbucks carbon tones are pleasantly lost in the expansive complexity of the coffee until the aftertaste, when they surface after the rest of the profile has passed into memory.",, Apr 1997
83.0,Sumatra,"This ingratiating dark roast comes straight at us, forgoing drama and intrigue. Not much Sumatra-style resonance behind its first sweet-pungent impression, but balanced and pleasing.",, Apr 1997
81.0,"San Juanillo Estate, French","First pungent then complex, the aroma is full of intrigue. We get a bit less in the cup, but given the darkness of the roast what remains is still impressive: enough acidity to keep the body lively, and generally an admirable balance between the qualities of the coffee and the impact of the roast.",, Apr 1997
80.0,Sumatra Gayo Mountain,"Dark fruit (prune?) tones complicate a solid, balanced, dark-roast character. Some carbon at the top of the profile, but good Indonesia richness underneath. The carbon dominates in the aftertaste.",, Apr 1997
79.0,Java,"Hard, high notes surprise in both aroma and cup, persisting into the aftertaste. But if you taste attentively the fundamental, Indonesian matrix of the coffee emerges beneath the sharpness: rich, subtly low-toned, balanced, with some tones that even could be called chocolate. In the first round of cupping the sharp notes seemed to energize the coffee; in the second they just tasted sharp.",, Apr 1997
77.0,Celebes Kalossi,"Depending on whether your palate reads the fermented notes as pleasantly fruity or disagreeably cloying, you could love or loath this coffee. If you think you might love it, ignore the rating, which deducts for the ferment. Under the impact of the dark roast the ferment turns lush, almost spicy. Displays the usual Indonesia virtue of solid body.",, Apr 1997
93.0,Kenya AA,"One more terrific, full-bore Kenya. The rich, winy acidity carries us up and out, expanding the boundaries of the profile and revealing the usual mouth-filling resonance at the heart of the coffee.",Price: NA, Mar 1997
91.0,Kenya AA,"The characteristically powerful, Burgundy-like Kenya acidity dominates, but if you're patient an immense and subtle richness opens beneath it, assuring a long finish and a resonant aftertaste.",, Mar 1997
90.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"Floral and vanilla tones hover in the high-toned acidity, exciting without distracting. The acidity is authoritative despite its floral delicacy and the body surprisingly substantial, although the entire profile loses momentum in the finish.",, Mar 1997
90.0,Kenya AA,"For a Kenya, displays a relatively restrained acidity. In another coffee this gentleness might be a fault, but here it reads as understatement, a polite permission for the complexity and echoing dimension of the coffee to emerge without getting upstaged by acidy dramatics.",, Mar 1997
89.0,Smaldeel Estate,"The only Zimbabwe in the cupping. Lighter and drier than the best Kenya, with less dimension in the cup and a somewhat more attenuated finish. The pleasure is in the superb top of this coffee, both aroma and acidity levitating with dry fruit and cinnamon tones.",, Mar 1997
89.0,Ethiopia Yirgacheffe,"Another flower-laced Yirgacheffe, shimmering with rose and lavender notes. Enough acidity to sustain the fruit and flower innuendoes, but rather light-bodied. Some carbon thinness seems to emerge as the coffee cools. Depending on whether you find the very pronounced flower tones a delight or a distraction, this coffee could merit anywhere from an 80 to a 100. I (roughly) split the difference.",, Mar 1997
87.0,Kenya AA,"The Kenya wine tones are lighter here, more Bordeaux than Burgundy. The profile is also simpler than in many Kenyas, but the high, singing tones of the acidity please until the aftertaste, when they turn slightly astringent.",, Mar 1997
84.0,Kenya AA,"Carbon tones overlay the sweet fruit fragrances of this dark-roasted Kenya, dampening but not obliterating them. A remarkable body and dimension open underneath the carbon, assuring a long, complex finish.",, Mar 1997
81.0,Ethiopia Longberry Harrar,"Impressive complexity for such a dark-roasted coffee. Prune and vanilla tones grace the aroma, while a fruit-nuanced acidity dominates in the cup. As the coffee cools suggestions of ferment surface in the fruity acidity.",, Mar 1997
